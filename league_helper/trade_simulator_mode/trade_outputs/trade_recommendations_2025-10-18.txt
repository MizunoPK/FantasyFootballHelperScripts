CURRENT ROSTER ANALYSIS
================================================================================

STRENGTHS:
✓ QB: Patrick Mahomes (elite, performing well)
✓ WR: Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR core performing)
✓ WR: Jaylen Waddle (WR15 in PPR, leading Miami WRs with Hill out for season)
✓ TE: Travis Kelce (recent strong performances, sell-high window)

WEAKNESSES:
✗ RB: TreVeyon Henderson (MAJOR BUST - zero explosive runs, 46th in missed tackles)
✗ RB: Rhamondre Stevenson (limited upside, though good Week 7 matchup)
✗ RB: RJ Harvey (underperforming, <33% snap share in 5/6 games)
✗ Overall RB depth is CRITICAL WEAKNESS

PRIORITY: Upgrade RB position, dump Henderson

================================================================================
TRADE RECOMMENDATIONS - RANKED BEST TO WORST
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK #1 - STRONGLY RECOMMEND ★★★★★
Trade #7 from original file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIVE: TreVeyon Henderson + Rhamondre Stevenson
GET:  Alvin Kamara + 49ers D/ST

EXPERT REASONING:

✓ DUMP HENDERSON: Experts unanimously say he's a bust
  - Zero explosive runs through 6 weeks
  - Ranks 46th in missed tackle rate, 47th in yards after contact
  - Season-low 29.7% snap rate in Week 6
  - FantasyPros: "Fantasy managers should panic about Henderson's poor output"
  - Multiple sources recommend sitting or dropping him

✓ UPGRADE TO KAMARA: Despite concerns, still a proven RB1/2
  - Currently RB28 in half-PPR (7.9 PPG)
  - Ankle injury concern (limited practice, questionable)
  - BUT: Maintains receiving role (59.4% route share, 18.8% target share)
  - Week 7 vs Patriots: Favorable passing game matchup (11th-highest YPC, 12th-most
    receiving yards allowed to RBs)
  - ESPN lists him as a "lineup lock" for Week 7
  - One proven RB1/2 > Two underperforming RBs

✓ STEVENSON CONSIDERATION: Has great Week 7 matchup but limited ceiling
  - Titans allow 4th-most rushing TDs (at least one to RB every game)
  - Stevenson gets 83% of goal-line attempts last 2 weeks
  - BUT: Low overall volume (10.7 touches, 51.9 total yards per game)
  - Only two top-20 finishes this season (RB6, RB18)
  - Trading him now moves an average asset for a proven star

WHY SAQUON DEEZ ACCEPTS THIS TRADE:

THEIR ROSTER:
- RBs: Saquon Barkley (elite RB1), Alvin Kamara, J.K. Dobbins
- WRs: Davante Adams, DK Metcalf, DJ Moore, Emeka Egbuka, Jauan Jennings
- Strong at WR, stacked at RB

✓ DEPTH PLAY: They have Saquon Barkley as clear RB1
  - Can afford to move Kamara (ankle injury concern)
  - J.K. Dobbins is solid RB2
  - Trading from strength to gain depth

✓ GETS TWO PATRIOTS RBS: Hedging their bets on NE backfield
  - Henderson has draft capital (high potential)
  - Stevenson has goal-line role
  - One might emerge as lead back ROS
  - Two okay RBs > one injured RB

✓ INJURY RISK MITIGATION: Kamara ankle injury is real
  - They're selling before it gets worse
  - Getting healthy bodies back

✗ CONCERN: Downgrading RB quality significantly
  - Kamara >> Henderson + Stevenson combined
  - Only makes sense if they're worried about Kamara's health

LIKELIHOOD THEY ACCEPT: Medium (30-40%)
- They're strong at RB, might not need depth
- Would need to be very concerned about Kamara's ankle
- Better for you than them, but possible if injury scares them

RISK LEVEL: Medium (Kamara's ankle injury)
REWARD POTENTIAL: High (consolidates two weak RBs into one RB1/2)
OVERALL GRADE: A

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK #2 - RECOMMEND ★★★★☆
Trade #12 from original file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIVE: Jaylen Waddle + TreVeyon Henderson
GET:  Chase Brown + Woody Marks

EXPERT REASONING:

✓ DUMP HENDERSON: (See Trade #7 reasoning above)

✓ CHASE BROWN UPSIDE: Rated EXCELLENT player rating
  - 83.45 actual points, 126.83 projected points
  - Current performance is "VERY_POOR (-37.5%)" = BUY LOW opportunity
  - Underperforming projections = positive regression expected
  - On bad Bengals offense but clear lead back

✓ WOODY MARKS BONUS: Performance rated EXCELLENT (+88.8%)
  - Outperforming projections significantly
  - 64.54 actual points on 108.80 projected
  - Provides RB depth

✗ WADDLE CONCERN: Giving up WR15 in PPR
  - Leading Miami WRs with Tyreek Hill OUT FOR SEASON
  - Since Week 5: 24.6% target share, 102.5 receiving yards per game
  - Week 7 vs Browns: Favorable matchup (61.3% single high coverage)
  - Against single high: 33.3% target share, 4.31 yards per route
  - Will remain WR2 moving forward per FantasyPros

VERDICT: This is a tough sell because Waddle is performing well and has a
secure role. However, your RB situation is desperate and WR depth is solid
(JSN, Pittman, Shakir, Golden). Getting two RBs with upside could balance
your roster.

WHY ANNIHILATORS ACCEPTS THIS TRADE:

THEIR ROSTER:
- RBs: Christian McCaffrey (RB1), Chase Brown, Chuba Hubbard, Jaylen Warren, Woody Marks
- WRs: Garrett Wilson, Keenan Allen, Brian Thomas Jr., Nico Collins, Mike Evans
- QB: Only Dak Prescott (no backup)
- Stacked at both RB and WR

✓ SELLING HIGH ON CHASE BROWN: Underperforming expectations
  - Projected 126.83 points but only 83.45 actual (VERY_POOR -37.5%)
  - Trading before further regression
  - Has CMC as elite RB1, can afford to move Brown

✓ SELLING HIGH ON WOODY MARKS: Overperforming bench piece
  - Performing at +88.8% above expectations (unsustainable)
  - Currently just bench depth behind CMC, Brown, Hubbard
  - Perfect time to cash in on hot hand

✓ UPGRADES WR CORPS: Waddle slots in as WR2/3
  - Current WRs: Garrett Wilson (inconsistent), Keenan Allen (aging)
  - Waddle (WR15) is immediate upgrade and younger
  - Miami's clear WR1 with Hill out ROS
  - Mike Evans injured often, Nico Collins injured
  - Waddle provides consistency they lack

✓ GETS HENDERSON: Lottery ticket RB
  - Henderson has high draft capital
  - If he figures it out, could be valuable
  - Low risk addition since they're deep at RB

LIKELIHOOD THEY ACCEPT: High (60-70%)
- They have RB depth to spare (CMC, Hubbard, Warren)
- WR corps is old/injured (Evans, Allen, Collins banged up)
- Waddle is a clear WR upgrade for starting lineup
- Selling two bench RBs for starting WR makes sense
- They win if Waddle stays healthy and Brown regresses further

RISK LEVEL: Medium-High (losing WR15 production)
REWARD POTENTIAL: High (two RBs with upside, Brown buy-low)
OVERALL GRADE: B+

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK #3 - CAUTIOUSLY RECOMMEND ★★★☆☆
Trade #5 from original file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIVE: Jaylen Waddle + TreVeyon Henderson
GET:  Tetairoa McMillan + Jordan Mason

EXPERT REASONING:

✓ DUMP HENDERSON: (See Trade #7 reasoning above)

✓ JORDAN MASON: Vikings lead back with Aaron Jones on IR
  - Week 7 vs Eagles: Favorable matchup
    * Eagles rank 24th in yards per attempt allowed
    * 30th in rushing first downs allowed
    * Only 3 teams have surrendered more rushing TDs
  - Recent Week 6: 13 carries for 52 yards + TD, 3 receptions
  - Vikings gave him 2-year deal with $7M+ guaranteed = commitment
  - RotoBaller: "Should be considered RB2/high-end Flex play"

✗ MCMILLAN WEEK 7 CONCERN: Tough matchup this week
  - Faces Jets CB Sauce Gardner in shadow coverage
  - Gardner has allowed only 10 catches, 170 yards all season
  - No WR has surpassed 57 yards in Gardner's coverage
  - FantasyPros: "This might not be a banner week for him"

✗ WADDLE CONCERN: (See Trade #12 reasoning above)
  - Still giving up WR15 in PPR with secure role

✓ MCMILLAN ROS: Strong rookie with upside
  - WR28 in fantasy PPG
  - 8th-most deep targets, 14th-most red zone targets
  - 63.3 receiving yards per game
  - "Star in the making" per FantasyPros

VERDICT: Mason is a clear RB upgrade and McMillan has upside, but Week 7
specifically is rough for McMillan. If you can absorb one down week,
McMillan's ROS outlook is positive.

WHY STRIKING SHIBAS ACCEPTS THIS TRADE:

THEIR ROSTER:
- RBs: De'Von Achane, Kyren Williams, Jordan Mason, Blake Corum, Aaron Jones (IR), Joe Mixon (NFI-R)
- WRs: Justin Jefferson (WR1), Drake London, Tetairoa McMillan, Ladd McConkey, Stefon Diggs
- QBs: Drake Maye, Jayden Daniels (dual-threat upside)
- Deep at RB, need WR help behind Jefferson

✓ RB DEPTH ALLOWS TRADE: Stacked at RB even without Mason
  - De'Von Achane is explosive RB1
  - Kyren Williams is solid RB2
  - Aaron Jones returning from IR soon (Vikings lead back pre-injury)
  - Joe Mixon could return (Texans RB1)
  - Blake Corum as handcuff
  - Can afford to move Mason for WR upgrade

✓ WADDLE MASSIVE WR UPGRADE: Current WR2 is weak
  - Justin Jefferson is elite WR1, but need better WR2
  - Drake London inconsistent, McMillan is rookie
  - Stefon Diggs older/declining, Ladd McConkey boom/bust
  - Waddle (WR15 in PPR) is immediate WR2 upgrade
  - Miami WR1 with Hill out = target monster ROS

✓ HENDERSON LOTTERY TICKET: Has upside if he figures it out
  - High draft capital (2nd round rookie)
  - New England could pivot to him if Stevenson keeps struggling
  - Zero risk for them given RB depth

✗ SELLING McMillan: Rookie WR showing promise
  - 8th-most deep targets, 14th-most red zone targets
  - Panthers WR1 (volume floor)
  - "Star in the making" per experts
  - But Waddle is proven commodity vs rookie unknown

LIKELIHOOD THEY ACCEPT: Very High (70-80%)
- They're STACKED at RB (Achane, Williams, Jones returning, Mixon maybe)
- WR corps is weak outside Jefferson
- Mason is expendable with Jones/Mixon returning
- Waddle + Henderson for McMillan + Mason favors them
- This is a "selling from strength" trade for them

RISK LEVEL: Medium (Waddle production, McMillan Week 7 matchup)
REWARD POTENTIAL: Medium-High (Mason lead back role, McMillan upside)
OVERALL GRADE: B

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK #4 - NEUTRAL/CONSIDER ★★★☆☆
Trade #9 from original file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIVE: Patrick Mahomes + TreVeyon Henderson
GET:  Drake Maye + Jordan Mason

EXPERT REASONING:

✓ DUMP HENDERSON: (See Trade #7 reasoning above)

✓ JORDAN MASON: (See Trade #5 reasoning above)
  - Gets you the RB help you desperately need

✗ MAHOMES DOWNGRADE: Trading elite QB for rookie
  - Mahomes: 149.47 actual points, 223.23 projected (GOOD rating)
  - Drake Maye: 125.57 actual points, 200.21 projected (NEUTRAL rating)
  - Mahomes performing at 33.5% above baseline vs Maye's 25.2%
  - Maye is on Patriots (worse offense than Chiefs)

✓ MAYE UPSIDE: Young QB with rushing ability
  - Still has GOOD performance rating
  - Rookie with growth potential
  - Same bye week concern (Week 14)

VERDICT: You're trading an elite QB for an RB upgrade. In most formats,
elite QBs are less scarce than RBs, so this could make sense. However,
Mahomes is having a great season. Only do this if you're desperate for RB
help and believe Justin Fields can fill in adequately.

WHY STRIKING SHIBAS ACCEPTS THIS TRADE:

THEIR ROSTER: (Same as Trade #5)
- RBs: De'Von Achane, Kyren Williams, Jordan Mason, Blake Corum, Aaron Jones (IR), Joe Mixon (NFI-R)
- WRs: Justin Jefferson, Drake London, Tetairoa McMillan, Ladd McConkey, Stefon Diggs
- QBs: Drake Maye, Jayden Daniels
- Deep at RB, have TWO promising young QBs

✓ MAHOMES ELITE UPGRADE: Massive QB improvement
  - Drake Maye is promising rookie but still just NEUTRAL rating
  - Jayden Daniels has upside but unproven
  - Mahomes is ELITE QB1 (149.47 pts, +33.5% performance)
  - Chiefs offense >>> Patriots/Commanders
  - Locks in QB1 spot ROS

✓ CAN SPARE MASON: (Same reasoning as Trade #5)
  - Aaron Jones returning from IR (was Vikings RB1)
  - Joe Mixon could return (Texans RB1)
  - Achane + Williams can carry RB duties
  - Trading from RB surplus

✓ HENDERSON LOTTERY TICKET: Free addition
  - Has high upside if he breaks out
  - Low-risk with their RB depth

✗ DOWNGRADE FROM TWO QBs TO ONE: Flexibility loss
  - Had Drake Maye vs bad defenses, Daniels for rushing upside
  - Now stuck with just Mahomes (though he's elite)
  - Superflex leagues would hate this, standard it's fine

LIKELIHOOD THEY ACCEPT: Medium-High (65-75%)
- Mahomes is a clear upgrade over Maye/Daniels
- They can afford to trade Mason (RB depth)
- If this is a 1QB league, getting elite QB is valuable
- If superflex/2QB league, they probably decline (need 2 QBs)
- Trade makes sense if they want to consolidate talent

RISK LEVEL: Medium-High (downgrading elite QB position)
REWARD POTENTIAL: Medium (Mason RB help, but QB downgrade hurts)
OVERALL GRADE: C+

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK #5 - DO NOT RECOMMEND ★★☆☆☆
Trade #1 from original file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIVE: Jaylen Waddle + Rhamondre Stevenson
GET:  Xavier Worthy + Tony Pollard

EXPERT REASONING:

✗ TONY POLLARD: Experts say AVOID at all costs
  - Currently RB32 in half-PPR (9.6 PPG)
  - Week 6: OUT-SNAPPED by Tyjae Spears (59% vs 43%)
  - Routes dipped to just 25% in Week 6
  - Week 7 matchup: "Brutal" vs Patriots
  - FantasyPros: "Trending in the completely wrong direction"
  - "Priority SELL candidate for weeks"
  - "Merely an emergency RB2/Flex in 12-team leagues"
  - Brian Callahan fired = uncertain backfield direction

✓ XAVIER WORTHY: Good Week 7 matchup but concerns
  - Week 7 vs Raiders: Great matchup (2nd-most receiving yards allowed to WRs)
  - Since Week 4: 70.2% route share, 19.4% target share, 22.4% first-read share
  - Should see single high coverage (favorable for Worthy)
  - Expected: 3.13 yards per route run vs single high

  BUT: Rashee Rice returning next week
  - When Rice played last year, Worthy averaged just 4 targets, 5 fantasy PPG
  - Rice limited Worthy to 34 yards or less in 3 games
  - Rice will be "No. 1 WR showcase" per experts
  - Worthy becomes clear WR2 on offense

✗ WADDLE CONCERN: Giving up WR15 for uncertain WR situation
  - Waddle has secure WR2 role ROS
  - Worthy has question marks after Week 7

VERDICT: Pollard is a landmine. Experts universally hate this trade for you.
Even if Worthy has one good week, he'll lose targets to Rice. You're giving
up Waddle's consistency for volatility.

WHY THE ESKIMO BROTHERS ACCEPTS THIS TRADE:

THEIR ROSTER:
- RBs: Travis Etienne (RB1), Tony Pollard, Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Quinshon Judkins, Kimani Vidal
- WRs: Tee Higgins, Rome Odunze, Courtland Sutton, Rashid Shaheed, Xavier Worthy
- TEs: Darren Waller, George Kittle (IR)
- QB: Baker Mayfield, Jaxson Dart
- Weak at RB after Etienne, decent at WR

✓ UPGRADES RB DEPTH: Gets Stevenson for Pollard
  - Pollard is trending DOWN (out-snapped, brutal matchups)
  - Stevenson has goal-line role, better Week 7 matchup
  - Lateral move at worst, possible upgrade

✓ SELLS WORTHY BEFORE RICE RETURNS: Smart timing
  - Rashee Rice returning next week tanks Worthy's value
  - Worthy will go from WR2 to clear WR3 on Chiefs
  - Selling at peak value (good Week 7 matchup)

✓ WADDLE CLEAR WR UPGRADE: Better than their WR corps
  - Waddle (WR15) >> Tee Higgins (injured/inconsistent)
  - Better than Rome Odunze (rookie), Sutton (declining)
  - Gives them legit WR1/WR2 with Waddle + Higgins

✓ GETS LOTTERY TICKET: Stevenson could emerge
  - Patriots might shift to Stevenson-heavy approach
  - Goal-line role is valuable in PPR
  - Upside > Pollard's downside

LIKELIHOOD THEY ACCEPT: Very High (75-85%)
- They're desperate to dump Pollard before complete collapse
- Worthy value is about to crash with Rice returning
- Waddle is a massive WR upgrade for them
- Stevenson > Pollard ROS (both low-end but Stevenson safer)
- This trade heavily favors them, which is why it's bad for you

RISK LEVEL: High (Pollard trending down, Worthy role uncertain)
REWARD POTENTIAL: Low (Pollard has minimal upside)
OVERALL GRADE: D

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK #6 - DO NOT RECOMMEND ★★☆☆☆
Trade #4 from original file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIVE: Rhamondre Stevenson + RJ Harvey
GET:  Tony Pollard + Kimani Vidal

EXPERT REASONING:

✗ TONY POLLARD: (See Trade #1 reasoning above)
  - Do not acquire this player

✗ KIMANI VIDAL: Rated VERY_POOR player rating
  - 35.31 actual points, 66.41 projected
  - Backup on Chargers behind J.K. Dobbins
  - No standalone value

✗ RJ HARVEY: While underperforming, still has more upside than these returns
  - Harvey is struggling but on a Sean Payton offense
  - At least has potential if Dobbins gets hurt

✗ STEVENSON: Has good Week 7 matchup
  - Why trade him for Pollard who has brutal matchup?

VERDICT: Trading two underperforming RBs for two worse RBs. This makes your
RB situation even worse. Hard pass.

WHY THE ESKIMO BROTHERS ACCEPTS THIS TRADE:

THEIR ROSTER: (Same as Trade #1)
- RBs: Travis Etienne (RB1), Tony Pollard, Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Quinshon Judkins, Kimani Vidal
- WRs: Tee Higgins, Rome Odunze, Courtland Sutton, Rashid Shaheed, Xavier Worthy
- Weak RB depth behind Etienne

✓ DUMPS POLLARD + VIDAL: Selling low but getting out
  - Pollard trending down hard (see Trade #1 analysis)
  - Kimani Vidal is VERY_POOR rated backup
  - Trading two sinking ships

✓ GETS STEVENSON: Slight RB upgrade
  - Stevenson has better Week 7 matchup than Pollard
  - Goal-line role (83% of attempts last 2 weeks)
  - Patriots RB situation might improve

✓ GETS RJ HARVEY: Sean Payton RB lottery ticket
  - Harvey is on Broncos (Payton typically supports RB production)
  - Has upside if Dobbins gets hurt
  - Better than Vidal (chargers backup)

✗ DOWNGRADING QUALITY: Getting two struggling RBs
  - Stevenson and Harvey are both underperforming
  - Neither has shown RB2 upside yet
  - Quantity over quality play

LIKELIHOOD THEY ACCEPT: Medium (50-60%)
- Depends on how desperate they are to dump Pollard
- If they believe in Stevenson/Harvey upside > Pollard/Vidal
- Harvey at least has Sean Payton, Vidal has nothing
- They might just hold Pollard and hope he turns it around
- Lateral move at best, so not super compelling for them

RISK LEVEL: Very High (getting worse players)
REWARD POTENTIAL: Very Low (no upside here)
OVERALL GRADE: F

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK #7 - DO NOT RECOMMEND ★☆☆☆☆
Trade #3 from original file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIVE: Rhamondre Stevenson
GET:  Justice Hill

EXPERT REASONING:

✗ JUSTICE HILL: Ravens have BYE in Week 7
  - ZERO fantasy value for Week 7
  - You'd be trading Stevenson (great Week 7 matchup) for a player on bye
  - This makes no sense for this week

✓ HILL ROS: Has some value in PPR
  - Passing-catching complement to Derrick Henry
  - Viable weekly flex option in PPR formats
  - Would get first crack at lead role if Henry injured

✗ STEVENSON WEEK 7: Excellent matchup you'd be giving up
  - Titans allow most rushing TDs to RBs (at least 1 every game)
  - Stevenson gets 83% of goal-line attempts
  - Patriots projected 24.5 points (9th-best)

VERDICT: Terrible timing. Even if Hill has ROS value, you can't start him
Week 7. Don't trade away a good Week 7 matchup for a bye week player.

WHY PIDGIN ACCEPTS THIS TRADE:

THEIR ROSTER:
- RBs: Kenneth Walker III (RB1), Justice Hill, Tyler Allgeier, Zach Charbonnet, Trey Benson (IR), Bam Knight
- WRs: A.J. Brown (elite WR1), Cooper Kupp, Zay Flowers, Darnell Mooney
- TEs: Kyle Pitts, Mark Andrews (both inconsistent)
- QBs: Jalen Hurts, Kyler Murray
- Good at WR/QB, need RB depth

✓ STEVENSON IMMEDIATE HELP: Week 7 starter
  - Hill is on bye Week 7, can't help them
  - Stevenson has elite Week 7 matchup (Titans allow most rushing TDs)
  - Gets goal-line work (83% of attempts)
  - Immediate RB2 plug-in this week

✓ RB DEPTH UPGRADE: Kenneth Walker injury-prone
  - Walker is their only reliable RB
  - Allgeier, Charbonnet, Benson all backups
  - Stevenson gives them legit RB2
  - Better than Hill (backup to Derrick Henry)

✗ LOSES HILL ROS VALUE: Hill has PPR upside
  - Hill is passing-catching complement to Henry
  - Viable flex in PPR formats
  - Stevenson only marginally better ROS
  - Both are low-end RB2/Flex plays

LIKELIHOOD THEY ACCEPT: Medium-Low (40-50%)
- Depends if they need Week 7 help desperately
- If they're fighting for playoffs, immediate help matters
- If they're comfortable, they might hold Hill for ROS
- Hill has more upside in PPR, Stevenson safer floor
- Lateral move that helps Week 7 but not much else

RISK LEVEL: High (no Week 7 value)
REWARD POTENTIAL: Low (Hill is just a flex option)
OVERALL GRADE: F

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK #8 - DO NOT RECOMMEND ★☆☆☆☆
Trade #6 from original file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIVE: Travis Kelce + Rhamondre Stevenson
GET:  Tony Pollard + Darren Waller

EXPERT REASONING:

✓ KELCE SELL WINDOW: Experts say sell high NOW
  - Recent strong games: 7-61-1 vs Jags, 6-78-0 vs Lions
  - Rashee Rice returning = major concern
  - Last year with Rice: Kelce averaged 4 targets, 5 fantasy PPG
  - With Rice emerging, Kelce limited to 34 yards or less in 3 games
  - Multiple experts: "Sell high immediately"
  - "Use strong performances to move Kelce before offense shifts to Rice"
  - Current trade value: 15.67 (ranks 5th among TEs)

✗ TONY POLLARD: (See Trade #1 reasoning above)
  - This is NOT the return you want for Kelce

✗ DARREN WALLER: Not enough of an upgrade
  - Rated POOR player rating
  - 55.86 actual points vs Kelce's 73.91
  - Performance: EXCELLENT (+150.2%) but small sample concerns
  - On Miami (less target volume than Kelce on Chiefs)

✗ STEVENSON: Good Week 7 matchup being wasted

VERDICT: You should sell Kelce high, but NOT for Pollard + Waller. This is
selling low disguised as selling high. If you're moving Kelce, get a quality
RB1 or WR1 in return, not Pollard who experts hate.

WHY THE ESKIMO BROTHERS ACCEPTS THIS TRADE:

THEIR ROSTER: (Same as Trades #1, #4)
- RBs: Travis Etienne (RB1), Tony Pollard, Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Quinshon Judkins, Kimani Vidal
- WRs: Tee Higgins, Rome Odunze, Courtland Sutton, Rashid Shaheed, Xavier Worthy
- TEs: Darren Waller, George Kittle (IR)
- Weak at RB, have two TEs already

✓ KELCE ELITE UPGRADE: Massive TE improvement
  - Kelce (73.91 pts) >> Waller (55.86 pts)
  - Kelce on Chiefs offense vs Waller on Dolphins
  - Even with Rashee Rice returning, Kelce > Waller
  - Locks in top-5 TE ROS

✓ DUMPS POLLARD: (See Trade #1 analysis)
  - Pollard trending down, desperate to sell
  - Getting Stevenson (goal-line work) is lateral/upgrade
  - Even if Stevenson struggles, better than Pollard's trajectory

✓ HAVE KITTLE BACKUP: George Kittle on IR
  - Kittle could return and be their TE1
  - Trading Waller while he has value (overperforming +150.2%)
  - Kelce + Kittle is elite TE duo

LIKELIHOOD THEY ACCEPT: Very High (80-90%)
- Getting elite TE1 for overperforming TE2 + trash RB
- Kelce is a massive upgrade even with Rice concerns
- Dumping Pollard is addition by subtraction
- Stevenson at least playable, Pollard is not
- This trade HEAVILY favors them, which is why it's terrible for you

RISK LEVEL: Very High (terrible return for Kelce)
REWARD POTENTIAL: Very Low (downgrading at both positions)
OVERALL GRADE: F

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK #9 - DO NOT RECOMMEND ★☆☆☆☆
Trade #2 from original file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIVE: TreVeyon Henderson + Chris Boswell
GET:  Justice Hill + Jake Elliott

EXPERT REASONING:

✓ DUMP HENDERSON: (See Trade #7 reasoning above)

✗ JUSTICE HILL: (See Trade #3 reasoning above)
  - Ravens bye Week 7 = no value this week
  - Not enough of an upgrade over Henderson to justify losing Boswell

✗ KICKER DOWNGRADE: Boswell > Elliott
  - Boswell: 54.20 actual points, 94.34 projected
  - Elliott: 48.19 actual points, 83.88 projected
  - Boswell on better Steelers offense
  - Performance: Boswell +17.6% vs Elliott -16.4%

VERDICT: Yes, dump Henderson, but not for a bye-week player and a kicker
downgrade. You can get better value for Henderson + Boswell elsewhere.

WHY PIDGIN ACCEPTS THIS TRADE:

THEIR ROSTER: (Same as Trade #3)
- RBs: Kenneth Walker III, Justice Hill, Tyler Allgeier, Zach Charbonnet, Trey Benson (IR), Bam Knight
- WRs: A.J. Brown, Cooper Kupp, Zay Flowers, Darnell Mooney
- K: Jake Elliott
- Need RB depth behind Walker

✓ HENDERSON UPSIDE: Lottery ticket RB
  - High draft capital rookie
  - If he breaks out, could be valuable
  - Better upside than their backups (Allgeier, Charbonnet)
  - Zero downside given Hill is on bye anyway

✓ BOSWELL UPGRADE: Kicker improvement
  - Boswell (54.20 pts) > Elliott (48.19 pts)
  - Boswell on better offense (Steelers > Eagles)
  - Performance: Boswell +17.6% vs Elliott -16.4%
  - Getting better kicker as bonus

✗ TRADES AWAY HILL: Has PPR value ROS
  - Hill is viable weekly flex (passing-catching role)
  - Henderson is currently bust
  - Trading proven commodity for unknown
  - Hill > Henderson ROS (unless Henderson breaks out)

LIKELIHOOD THEY ACCEPT: Medium (45-55%)
- Hill is on bye Week 7 anyway, so timing doesn't hurt them
- If they believe in Henderson's upside, makes sense
- Boswell upgrade sweetens the deal
- But Hill has proven value, Henderson doesn't
- Would need to really believe Patriots pivot to Henderson

RISK LEVEL: Medium-High (Hill on bye, kicker downgrade)
REWARD POTENTIAL: Very Low (marginal upgrade at RB)
OVERALL GRADE: F

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANK #10 - DO NOT RECOMMEND ★☆☆☆☆
Trade #10 from original file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIVE: TreVeyon Henderson + RJ Harvey
GET:  Justice Hill + Tyler Allgeier

EXPERT REASONING:

✓ DUMP HENDERSON: (See Trade #7 reasoning above)

✗ JUSTICE HILL: (See Trade #3 reasoning above)
  - Ravens bye Week 7
  - No value this week when you need RB help

✓ TYLER ALLGEIER: Some upside as Falcons backup
  - 45.78 actual points, 74.30 projected
  - Performance: GOOD (+35.6%)
  - Could have value if Bijan Robinson gets hurt
  - Week 7: Bye week (same as Ravens)

✗ RJ HARVEY: While struggling, at least playable
  - Harvey has more upside than Allgeier
  - Sean Payton offense vs Falcons backup role

VERDICT: Trading two struggling but playable RBs for two bye-week RBs. This
leaves you with NO RB options for Week 7. Terrible timing.

WHY PIDGIN ACCEPTS THIS TRADE:

THEIR ROSTER: (Same as Trades #2, #3)
- RBs: Kenneth Walker III, Justice Hill, Tyler Allgeier, Zach Charbonnet, Trey Benson (IR), Bam Knight
- WRs: A.J. Brown, Cooper Kupp, Zay Flowers, Darnell Mooney
- Need RB depth behind Walker

✓ QUANTITY FOR LOTTERY TICKETS: Two unknowns for two bench pieces
  - Henderson has draft capital, could break out
  - RJ Harvey on Sean Payton offense (RB-friendly system)
  - Both have theoretical upside > Hill/Allgeier

✓ HILL + ALLGEIER ON BYE: Don't need them Week 7
  - Both are on bye Week 7 (Ravens, Falcons)
  - Can't help their team this week anyway
  - No downside to trading them now

✓ ALLGEIER EXPENDABLE: Backup to Bijan Robinson
  - Tyler Allgeier is just Bijan handcuff
  - No standalone value unless Bijan injured
  - Harvey could have standalone value in Broncos system

✗ TRADING PROVEN FOR UNPROVEN: Hill/Allgeier have shown production
  - Hill: +115.6% performance (48.71 pts actual)
  - Allgeier: +35.6% performance (45.78 pts actual)
  - Both outperforming, Henderson/Harvey underperforming
  - Giving up current production for future hope

LIKELIHOOD THEY ACCEPT: Low (25-35%)
- Hill and Allgeier are both outperforming expectations
- Henderson is a confirmed bust so far
- Harvey is struggling (sub-33% snaps most games)
- Trading two assets performing well for two busts
- Only makes sense if they're very high on Henderson/Harvey upside
- Probably decline unless they love the lottery ticket approach

RISK LEVEL: Very High (both returns on bye Week 7)
REWARD POTENTIAL: Very Low (backups with limited upside)
OVERALL GRADE: F

================================================================================
SUMMARY & ACTION PLAN
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS (SORTED BY ACCEPTANCE LIKELIHOOD):

1. PRIORITIZE TRADE #5 (McMillan + Mason) - 70-80% acceptance likelihood ★★★
   - Striking Shibas VERY LIKELY to accept
   - They're stacked at RB (Achane, Williams, Jones/Mixon returning)
   - Need WR2 behind Justin Jefferson badly
   - Waddle is immediate starter, Mason expendable for them
   - INITIATE THIS TRADE FIRST

2. PRIORITIZE TRADE #12 (Chase Brown + Woody Marks) - 60-70% acceptance likelihood ★★★
   - Annihilators LIKELY to accept
   - They have CMC as RB1, can spare Brown/Marks
   - WR corps old/injured (Evans, Allen, Collins banged up)
   - Waddle is clear upgrade, selling high on overperforming Marks
   - STRONG SECOND OPTION

3. CONSIDER TRADE #9 (Drake Maye + Mason) - 65-75% acceptance likelihood ★★
   - Striking Shibas might accept for Mahomes upgrade
   - QB upgrade + dumping expendable Mason
   - BUT you're downgrading from elite QB
   - Only if desperate for RB help

4. AVOID TRADE #7 (Kamara deal) - 30-40% acceptance likelihood ★
   - Saquon Deez UNLIKELY to accept
   - They're strong at RB, don't need depth
   - Would need to be very scared of Kamara's ankle injury
   - Try proposing but don't expect acceptance

5. AVOID ALL TONY POLLARD TRADES
   - Trades #1, #4, #6 all involve Pollard
   - Experts universally negative on Pollard
   - Out-snapped, brutal matchups, trending wrong direction
   - Even though opponents would accept, terrible for you

6. DON'T TRADE FOR BYE WEEK PLAYERS (Week 7)
   - Justice Hill (Trades #2, #3, #10): Ravens bye
   - Tyler Allgeier (Trade #10): Falcons bye
   - Need players who can help you WIN THIS WEEK

7. IF SELLING KELCE, get better return than Pollard + Waller
   - Kelce should fetch an RB1 or high-end WR1
   - Don't sell low just because Rice is returning

REALISTIC TRADE STRATEGY (ACCEPTANCE LIKELIHOOD RANKING)
================================================================================

MOST LIKELY TO BE ACCEPTED (prioritize proposing these):
1. Trade #6: Pollard + Waller (80-90%) - BUT TERRIBLE VALUE, DON'T DO IT
2. Trade #1: Worthy + Pollard (75-85%) - BUT TERRIBLE VALUE, DON'T DO IT
3. Trade #5: McMillan + Mason (70-80%) - GOOD VALUE, DO THIS ★★★
4. Trade #9: Drake Maye + Mason (65-75%) - OKAY VALUE, CONSIDER IF DESPERATE
5. Trade #12: Chase Brown + Woody Marks (60-70%) - GOOD VALUE, DO THIS ★★★

MODERATELY LIKELY TO BE ACCEPTED:
6. Trade #4: Pollard + Vidal (50-60%) - TERRIBLE VALUE, AVOID
7. Trade #2: Hill + Elliott (45-55%) - TERRIBLE VALUE, AVOID
8. Trade #3: Justice Hill (40-50%) - TERRIBLE VALUE, AVOID

UNLIKELY TO BE ACCEPTED:
9. Trade #7: Kamara (30-40%) - BEST VALUE BUT HARD TO GET
10. Trade #10: Hill + Allgeier (25-35%) - TERRIBLE VALUE ANYWAY

KEY PLAYERS TO AVOID ACQUIRING:
❌ Tony Pollard (in Trades #1, #4, #6)
❌ Justice Hill for Week 7 (in Trades #2, #3, #10)
❌ Kimani Vidal (in Trade #4)

KEY PLAYERS TO TARGET:
✓ Alvin Kamara (Trade #7) - Best value, but hard to get
✓ Chase Brown (Trade #12) - Good value, likely accepted
✓ Jordan Mason (Trades #5, #9) - Very good value, very likely accepted
✓ Woody Marks (Trade #12) - Good value, likely accepted

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHT: BEST VALUE ≠ MOST LIKELY TO BE ACCEPTED
================================================================================

The best trade for YOU (Trade #7: Kamara) has only 30-40% acceptance likelihood
because Saquon Deez doesn't need the depth and Kamara is too valuable to them.

The worst trades for YOU (Trades #1, #6: Pollard deals) have 75-90% acceptance
likelihood because The Eskimo Brothers are DESPERATE to dump Pollard and get
your better players.

WINNING STRATEGY:
1. Propose Trade #5 to Striking Shibas (70-80% acceptance, Grade B)
   - They NEED WR help behind Jefferson
   - They're STACKED at RB and can spare Mason
   - Aaron Jones/Joe Mixon returning makes Mason expendable
   - This trade benefits both sides (win-win)

2. Propose Trade #12 to Annihilators (60-70% acceptance, Grade B+)
   - They NEED WR consistency (Evans/Allen/Collins injured)
   - They can spare RB depth (have CMC as stud RB1)
   - Selling high on Woody Marks (overperforming +88.8%)
   - Chase Brown buy-low opportunity

3. Throw out Trade #7 to Saquon Deez (30-40% acceptance, Grade A)
   - Worth trying, but don't expect acceptance
   - If Kamara's ankle scares them, they might bite
   - Best value if it works

DON'T FALL INTO THE TRAP:
- Just because they'll accept doesn't mean you should do it
- The Eskimo Brothers would LOVE to give you Pollard
- That's exactly why you shouldn't take him

================================================================================
OPPONENT ROSTER ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================

TEAMS MOST LIKELY TO TRADE WITH YOU:

1. STRIKING SHIBAS (Trades #5, #9) - BEST TRADE PARTNER
   - Surplus: RBs (Achane, Williams, Mason, Jones/Mixon returning)
   - Need: WR2 behind Justin Jefferson
   - Your offer: Waddle solves their biggest weakness
   - Win-win scenario

2. ANNIHILATORS (Trade #12) - GOOD TRADE PARTNER
   - Surplus: RB depth (CMC, Brown, Hubbard, Warren, Marks)
   - Need: Consistent WR (Evans/Allen/Collins all injured/old)
   - Your offer: Waddle provides WR consistency
   - Win-win scenario

3. THE ESKIMO BROTHERS (Trades #1, #4, #6) - AVOID
   - Surplus: None (weak roster)
   - Need: Everything (desperate)
   - Your offer: They'd love it, you'd hate it
   - Win-lose scenario (they win, you lose)

4. PIDGIN (Trades #2, #3, #10) - MARGINAL
   - Surplus: None really
   - Need: RB depth behind Kenneth Walker
   - Your offer: Lateral moves, bye week issues
   - Lose-lose scenario (neither benefits much)

5. SAQUON DEEZ (Trade #7) - HARD TO TRADE WITH
   - Surplus: RB depth (Saquon, Kamara, Dobbins)
   - Need: None (well-rounded team)
   - Your offer: Good, but they don't need it
   - Only works if Kamara injury scares them

================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

PROPOSE IN THIS ORDER:

1ST: Trade #5 to Striking Shibas (Waddle + Henderson for McMillan + Mason)
     → 70-80% acceptance, Grade B, helps both teams

2ND: Trade #12 to Annihilators (Waddle + Henderson for Brown + Marks)
     → 60-70% acceptance, Grade B+, helps both teams

3RD: Trade #7 to Saquon Deez (Henderson + Stevenson for Kamara + 49ers DST)
     → 30-40% acceptance, Grade A, but worth a shot

IF ALL FAIL: Hold your players, don't panic trade into bad deals with
The Eskimo Brothers just because they'll accept. Bad trades that get accepted
are still bad trades.

YOUR LEVERAGE: Multiple teams need what you have (Waddle, Stevenson)
- Use that leverage to get fair deals
- Don't settle for bad returns just to make a trade
- Henderson is a bust, but others don't know that yet (use him as sweetener)

================================================================================
END OF RECOMMENDATIONS
