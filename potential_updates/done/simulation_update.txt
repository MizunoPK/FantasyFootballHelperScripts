Help generate a simulation to determine what Config values would yield the best results during a Draft using the draft_helper.
During a draft, the user would be using the draft_helper (not in Trade mode) to determine what the best player to pick next would be. They would enter 'Mark Player as Drafted' mode when a different team drafts a player to mark the player as no longer available, then use the 'Add to Roster' mode to determine what player to pick next for their roster.
Assume the Draft has 10 teams, and that the user is one of those 10 teams.
The Simulation should test changes to different Config settings to determine what is most likely to yeild the best team at the end.
The Config settings could include ones such as base scores, penalties, weights and draft order.
The 'best team' is defined as the team with the highest total fantasy points at the end of the draft. 
Do your best to simulate real behavior from the other teams during the simulation
The simulation should be a sub-folder contained within the draft_helper folder, and accessible by a flag in the draft_helper's Config file
The simulation should not change any existing data files. It should make copies of files from shared_files and make use of those copies for the simulations.
The simulation should output a 'results.md' file that details the findings of the simulation.
The findings primarily include the optimal values for the config variables that were modified.
Use parallel threads to improve the time efficiency of the simulation, but we will accept having the simulation still take a long time. Ideally it shouldn't take more than an hour though.
Create unit tests unique to the simulation and have them within the simulation folder
