Add another option to the Main Menu in the draft helper - "Drop Player Mode"
When in 'Drop Player Mode', the system should allow the user to type in part of a player's name in the same way that is done for 'Mark Drafted Player Mode'. If the user selects one of those matches, then the corresponding player's data in players.csv should be updated to have drafted=0. This should functionally work the exact same as when we are in 'Mark Drafted Player Mode', except that only players with drafted != 0 should be searchable, and selected players will then be marked as drafted=0.
Add another mode called 'Lock/Unlock Player'. This should list out everyone on the user's Roster in two sections, one that are Unlocked players and one that are Locked players and let the user select one. The selected player should have their Locked value flipped in players.csv. After doing so, reload the list and let the user select another one. Each time the user is asked to select a player, give an option to go back to the main menu instead.
