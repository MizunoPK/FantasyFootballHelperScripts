OBJECTIVE: Simplify Fallback System - Week-by-Week Only Approach

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
The current multi-layered fallback system (week-by-week → remaining season → 2025 season → ADP estimation → zero) is creating data consistency bugs, field swapping issues, and complex maintenance overhead. The Ulysses Bentley IV case exemplifies these problems where fallbacks create inconsistent data_method tracking and missing weekly distributions.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Eliminate ALL fallback methods except week-by-week projections. If week-by-week data cannot be fetched or results in 0.0, players will simply have zero values across all columns. This creates a clean, predictable, and bug-free system.

PHILOSOPHY:
- Better to have accurate zeros than inaccurate estimates
- Simplicity reduces bugs and maintenance overhead
- Users can identify players with insufficient data easily
- Week-by-week is the most accurate method when available

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:

Phase 1 - Remove Fallback Methods:
1. Remove `_calculate_remaining_season_projection()` method entirely
2. Remove seasonal projection extraction from current season stats
3. Remove `_apply_empirical_adp_mapping()` method entirely
4. Remove `_estimate_fantasy_points_from_adp()` method entirely
5. Remove all ADP-related position mapping logic
6. Remove `_build_position_adp_mappings()` and supporting methods

Phase 2 - Simplify Main Processing Loop:
1. Remove all fallback variables (fallback_used, fallback_type)
2. Simplify fantasy_points assignment to ONLY use week-by-week results
3. Remove complex fallback conditional logic
4. Remove fallback logging messages

Phase 3 - Update Configuration:
1. Remove `USE_REMAINING_SEASON_PROJECTIONS` setting (no longer needed)
2. Remove `USE_WEEK_BY_WEEK_PROJECTIONS` toggle entirely (always enabled now)
3. Remove ADP-related configuration constants
4. Update config validation to reflect simplified system

Phase 4 - Remove Data Method Column Entirely:
1. Remove data_method field from all data models (ESPNPlayerData, FantasyPlayer)
2. Remove data_method from CSV exports and all file formats
3. Remove data_method tracking logic throughout codebase
4. Since there's only one method (week-by-week), the column provides no value

SPECIFIC CODE CHANGES NEEDED:

File: player-data-fetcher/espn_client.py
- Remove methods: _calculate_remaining_season_projection, _apply_empirical_adp_mapping, _estimate_fantasy_points_from_adp, _build_position_adp_mappings
- Simplify main processing loop to:
  ```python
  # Extract fantasy points using ONLY week-by-week calculation (always enabled)
  fantasy_points = await self._calculate_week_by_week_projection(id, name, position)
  # No conditional check needed - week-by-week is the only method
  # No data_method tracking needed - column removed entirely
  ```

File: player-data-fetcher/player_data_fetcher_config.py
- Remove USE_REMAINING_SEASON_PROJECTIONS
- Remove USE_WEEK_BY_WEEK_PROJECTIONS (always enabled now)
- Remove all ADP-related constants
- Simplify configuration validation

File: shared_files/fantasy_points_calculator.py
- Remove ADP estimation methods
- Remove historical fallback logic
- Keep only week-by-week extraction

File: player-data-fetcher/player_data_models.py
- Remove data_method field from ESPNPlayerData model

File: shared_files/FantasyPlayer.py
- Remove data_method field from FantasyPlayer class
- Update from_dict and to_dict methods to exclude data_method

BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH:

1. **Data Consistency**: No more mismatched fantasy_points vs weekly sums
2. **Simplified Debugging**: Only one code path to debug
3. **Transparent Results**: Users know exactly where data comes from
4. **No Field Swapping**: Eliminates complex ADP vs fantasy_points assignment
5. **Reduced Maintenance**: Much less code to maintain and test
6. **Clear Data Quality**: Zero values clearly indicate insufficient ESPN data

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:

Players with Good ESPN Data:
- Will have accurate week-by-week projections
- fantasy_points will equal sum of weekly columns

Players with Poor ESPN Data (like Ulysses Bentley IV):
- Will have fantasy_points = 0.0
- All weekly columns will be 0.0
- Users can easily identify these players by zero values for manual research

CONFIGURATION UPDATES:

Before:
```python
USE_WEEK_BY_WEEK_PROJECTIONS = True
USE_REMAINING_SEASON_PROJECTIONS = True
# + many ADP constants
```

After:
```python
# Week-by-week projections always enabled - no toggle needed
# All fallback settings removed entirely
```

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Test with high-profile players (should have good week-by-week data)
2. Test with backup players like Ulysses Bentley IV (should have zeros)
3. Verify data consistency: fantasy_points == sum(weekly_points) for ALL players
4. Ensure no field swapping (data_method column removed entirely)
5. Validate that zero players are clearly identifiable

ROLLBACK PLAN:
- Keep backup of current espn_client.py before changes
- Document removed methods in case restore is needed
- Maintain current config settings as comments initially

MIGRATION STRATEGY:
1. Implement changes in development branch
2. Run data fetcher and compare results
3. Verify data integrity across entire dataset
4. Update documentation to reflect simplified system
5. Remove fallback-related unit tests
6. Add new tests for simplified system

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ Only week-by-week projection method remains
✅ All fallback methods completely removed
✅ Data consistency: fantasy_points = sum(weekly_points) for ALL players
✅ data_method column completely removed from all models and exports
✅ No field swapping or assignment bugs
✅ Simplified configuration with fewer settings
✅ Reduced codebase complexity and maintenance overhead

PRIORITY: HIGH
- Eliminates root cause of data consistency bugs
- Significantly reduces system complexity
- Improves data quality and user trust

ESTIMATED EFFORT: 3-4 hours
- 1 hour removing fallback methods and code
- 1 hour updating configuration and validation
- 1-2 hours testing and verification
