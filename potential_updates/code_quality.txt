Systematically look through the repo for potential code quality updates in every file
Try to ensure consistent across files
Look for unused variables or functions that could be removed
Look for ways to improve distribution of responsibilities
Look for places that could have better comments
Look for places with repeated code that could be abstracted out to common functions/classes. Consider this for both code within scripts and between scripts - meaning this could result in a helper function either within the script itself or in the shared_files for access between scripts
Look for names of variables, functions, or classes that could be improved
Look for any other code quality updates you recommend.

Verify with me what code quality updates to move forward with, then begin making the TODO file for getting those code quality updates done
Ensure unit tests still pass periodically throughout the updates
