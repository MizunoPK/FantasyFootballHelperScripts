I want to centralize the config files.
Move all config files across the repo to the shared_files folder, in a subdirectory called 'configs'. You can essentially just look for any file with 'config' in the name. Rename any vague files to be more specific to what they are configs for.
Also move the DEFAULT_SCORING_CONFIG config from enhanced_scoring.py to the shared_config file and give it a more unique name like ENHANCED_SCORING_CONFIG
Run all unit tests and the entire integration test checklist to ensure nothing is broken. Refactor any tests that rely on the config files to point to the new locations.
