We are going to overhaul a portion of the Add to Roster mode in how it performs the calculations for players.
We are going to completely remove the 'positional need' portion of the score. This is depreciated. Remove the code entirely - don't just put it behind a toggle. See the The total projected points of the player will be the base of the player's score. When pulling in players it should normalize the score to be between 0 and 100. The max value for this normalization should be configurable and able to be manipulated in the Simulation config.
Injury penalties and bye week penalties will continue to be used as they currently are implemented.


The DRAFT_ORDER variable in the draft_helper config is going to be used for its originally intended behavior - which is to give players bonus points depending on if their position fits the expected positional priority based on the current round.
The DRAFT_ORDER array should be updated such that it contains 15 dictionaries, where each dictionary has a static value that the scorer will add to the scores for players with certain positions if it is that round and the player matches that position.
For example, if DRAFT_ORDER[0]={FLEX: 50, QB: 25}, and it is currently round 1, then any RB or WR would recieve 50 extra points, and QBs would recieve 25 extra points.
Maintain the positions and ordering that is currently in the existing DRAFT_ORDER variable, but update the values of the dictionary to static values.
The static values should be able to be configured in the Simulation config. 
Upon loading into the 'Add to Roster' mode, the system will assign each player currently in the roster to a certain round. The system should loop through each player, then loop through each round. The first round the system finds that is not yet associated with a player, and that the round's DRAFT_ORDER dictionary's highest scoring position matches the player, then the round will be associated with that player. After loading in the players in this way, then whatever round comes first that is not associated with a player will be considered the 'current round'.
See Draft_Order_Implementation_Analysis.md for an analysis on the current state of the positional need and draft order - this will help give context on what changes will be needed to remove positional need and expand draft order.

Remove the 'matchup consideration' in the Add to Roster calculations. The matchup between two teams should only be considered in the Starter Helper.


For the Starter Helper, we are going to stick with having the projected points of the current week be the baseline without any normalization. The system should then apply a Match Up multiplier. This multiplier should be calculated based on the difference in rank between the player's team and the opponent's team. Only apply this multiplier to QB,WR,RB, & TE - do not apply it to K or DEF. The multiplier should be set in a similar way to ADP or Player Ranking in other modes, where certain ranges are associated with certain multipliers. This should be configurable in the Simulation just like ADP and Player Ranking are, so that the Simulation can make use of these when using the starter helper to determine weekly lineups.
If the player is anything but ACTIVE or QUESTIONABLE, then their score should be zero'd out


To summarize, the scoring for players in each mode should look like this:
Add to Roster Mode:
1. Get the normalized seasonal total projected fantasy points.
2. Apply ADP Multiplier
3. Apply Player Ranking multiplier 
4. Apply Team ranking multiplier 
5. Add Draft Order value 
6. Subtract the Bye Week Penalty 
7. Subtract the Injury Penalty 

Waiver Optimizer:
1. Get the normalized seasonal total projected fantasy points.
2. Apply ADP Multiplier
3. Apply Player Ranking multiplier 
4. Apply Team ranking multiplier 
5. Subtract the Bye Week Penalty 
6. Subtract the Injury Penalty 

Starter Helper:
1. Get the projected points for the player on the current week
2. Apply Match Up multiplier
3. Subtract the Injury Penalty (different from the injury penalty in other calculations, essentially should just make it so when a player is not ACTIVE or QUESTIONABLE then their score should be zero'd out)

Trade Simulator:
1. Get the normalized seasonal total projected fantasy points.
2. Apply ADP Multiplier
3. Apply Player Ranking multiplier 
4. Apply Team ranking multiplier 
5. Subtract the Bye Week Penalty 
6. Subtract the Injury Penalty 

Be extremely modular in your approach to these changes. Break it down as much as you can in the TODO file and frequently run through the entirety of the pre-commit checklist (including running all unit tests and all integration tests). 
Update unit tests to reflect the changes.
Update documentation to reflect the changes. 
Ask me lots of questions to ensure you fully understand the objective, and ensure all details are included in the TODO file.
Ensure the TODO file stays up to date with all new info and progress.
Make any suggestions on ways to improve the plan for these changes.
