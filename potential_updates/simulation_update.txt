Help generate a plan for how to create a simulation to determine what Config values would yield the best results during a Draft using the draft_helper.
During a draft, the user would be using the draft_helper (not in Trade mode) to determine what the best player to pick next would be. They would enter 'Mark Player as Drafted' mode when a different team drafts a player to mark the player as no longer available, then use the 'Add to Roster' mode to determine what player to pick next for their roster.
Assume the Draft has 10 teams, and that the user is one of those 10 teams.
The Simulation should test changes to different Config settings to determine what is most likely to yeild the best team at the end.
The Config settings could include ones such as base scores, penalties, weights and draft order.
The 'best team' is defined as the team with the highest total fantasy points at the end of the draft. 
Do your best to simulate real behavior from the other teams during the simulation.
Put this detailed plan in a file called "Simulation_Plan.md"
Ask me any questions you have for clarification before generating the plan.
