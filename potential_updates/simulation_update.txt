Update the draft_helper Simulation to also test varying values for scoring based off ADP, player ranking, offensive ranking, and defensive ranking. 
These configs are in shared_files/enhanced_scoring.py
Create test configs to try different variations for every numerical value in the DEFAULT_SCORING_CONFIG
These configs should be implemented in similar ways to how the testing of different scoring weights already exists in the simulation.
Also, update the result.md files to be named result_{timestamp}.md and put into the draft_helper/Simulation/results folder
