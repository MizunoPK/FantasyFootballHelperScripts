We are going to update the draft helper when it is not in trade mode and make it more interactive.
When it starts up, it should be in 'Main Menu Mode'.
When in Main Manu Mode, the user will be able to select between 1. Add to Roster, 2. Mark Drafted Player, 3. Quit.
When selecting 1. the system will go to 'Add to Roster Mode'. When selecting 2. the system will go to 'Mark Drafted Player Mode'. When selecting 3. the system will exit the script completely.
When in 'Add to Roster Mode', the usual Draft Helper will commense where the system assesses the user's current roster and determines what player they should pick next during the draft. It should show the list of recommended players along with a 'Back' option that will send the system back to 'Main Menu Mode'. When the user selects a player they should be marked as drafted=2 in players.csv like usual and the system should go back to 'Main Menu Mode'.
When in 'Mark Drafted Player Mode', the system should allow the user to type in part of a player's name, then the system should pull up a list of potential matches. If the user selects one of those matches, then the corresponding player's data in players.csv should be updated to have drafted=1. Include selection options for 'Re-search' and 'Back', where 'Re-search' allows the user to try typing again, and 'Back' sends the user back to the 'Main Menu Mode'. When searching for matching players, be flexible and look for somewhat similar matches in addition to exact matches. 

Before starting changes, create a TODO file that maps out all the tasks that will need to be completed to accomplish this objective. As you complete the tasks, keep the file updated with your progress just in case a new Claude agent in a new session needs to finish the work. Ensure this TODO file has everything it needs to maintain consistent work - including a note about keeping the file up to date on progress made. Put the TODO file in the todo-files folder in this directory.
After updates are complete, verify that all unit tests still pass and test the system to ensure it is functional. Create/modify any relevant unit tests and test them to ensure they pass.
Update rules files and readme files according to the new changes.
Ask me any clarifying questions that would help you better understand and complete this objective.
