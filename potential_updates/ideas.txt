Based on the current state of the repo, what additions to functionality would you recommended? Keep in mind that these scripts are designed to help me succeed in and manage a Fantasy Football league, and any new additions to existing scripts or new scripts entirely should be productive toward those goals. Generate a report called 'potential_expansions.md' that contains details about the ideas.
