# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Environment

This is a Python 3.13.6 project using a virtual environment located at `.venv/` with a modern modular architecture featuring async operations, week-by-week projections, and type-safe data validation.

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (includes httpx, pydantic, tenacity, aiofiles)
.venv\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

**IMPORTANT**: All scripts are run from the root directory using wrapper scripts:

```bash
# Run player projections fetcher (ESPN API) - Advanced week-by-week system (8-15 min)
# CRITICAL: Update CURRENT_NFL_WEEK weekly in shared_config.py (centralized for all scripts)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_player_data_fetcher.py

# Run draft helper in draft mode (initial draft)
# Set TRADE_HELPER_MODE = False in draft_helper/config.py
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_draft_helper.py

# Run draft helper in trade mode (weekly trade analysis using pure greedy algorithm)
# Set TRADE_HELPER_MODE = True in draft_helper/config.py
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_draft_helper.py

# Run starter helper (weekly optimal lineup from CSV projections) - <1 second
# CRITICAL: Update CURRENT_NFL_WEEK weekly in shared_config.py (same location as above)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_starter_helper.py

# Run NFL scores fetcher (for data compilation)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_nfl_scores_fetcher.py
```

**Script Organization:**
- Main wrapper scripts (`run_*.py`) are in root directory
- Core modules are in subdirectories (`player-data-fetcher/`, `nfl-scores-fetcher/`, `draft_helper/`, `starter_helper/`)
- Wrapper scripts change to subdirectory and execute the actual script
- Shared components are in `shared_files/` directory

## Project Architecture

### Core Modules

**1. Player Data Fetcher (`player-data-fetcher/`)**
- **Week-by-Week Projection System**: Advanced optimization reducing API calls from 10,336 to 646 (16x improvement)
- **Smart Weekly Prioritization**: Past weeks use appliedTotal (actual), current/future weeks use projectedTotal (projected)
- **Async Architecture**: httpx client with tenacity retry logic and concurrent aiofiles export
- **Smart Data Preservation**: Maintains drafted/locked status with `SKIP_DRAFTED_PLAYER_UPDATES` optimization
- **Multi-Format Export**: Concurrent CSV, Excel, JSON output with timestamps (weeks 1-17 only)
- **Data Method Tracking**: Transparent reporting of data source for each player ("weekly", "seasonal", "adp", "zero")
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation with ADP/seasonal distribution when weekly data unavailable
- **Pydantic Models**: Type-safe data validation and serialization throughout pipeline
- **Configuration-Driven**: Modular config system with weekly `CURRENT_NFL_WEEK` updates

**2. Draft Helper (`draft_helper/`)**
- **Interactive Menu System**: Comprehensive 8-option menu with Add to Roster, Mark Drafted Player, Waiver Optimizer, Drop Player, Lock/Unlock Player, Starter Helper, Trade Simulator, and Quit

  - Simulate multiple sequential trades with fuzzy player search
  - Search both available (drafted=0) and drafted by others (drafted=1) players
  - Real-time score comparison with original roster (total + per-position breakdown)
  - Undo individual trades or reset to original roster
  - No data persistence - all changes are temporary and reset on exit
  - Full state management with error handling and input validation

**3. Starter Helper (`starter_helper/`)**
- **CSV-Based Projections**: Reads weekly projections from `week_N_points` columns (no API calls required)
- **Optimal Lineup Generation**: Creates best 9-player starting lineup with position constraints

  - Recent performance trends and home field advantage calculations
  - Configurable 15% weight factor impact on recommendations
  - Simple (★/○/●) or detailed display options with toggle control
- **Bench Recommendations**: Shows top bench alternatives with optional matchup context
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles large rosters efficiently (<1s offline, 3-5s with matchup analysis)

**4. NFL Scores Fetcher (`nfl-scores-fetcher/`)**
- **Async Score Collection**: Recent NFL game data with configurable time windows
- **Multi-Format Export**: CSV, JSON, Excel outputs for external spreadsheet integration
- **Modular Architecture**: Standalone client and export components
- **Configurable Filtering**: Completed games only, specific weeks, season type selection

### Fantasy Points Calculation System

**Updated Week-Based Priority Logic (September 2025):**

The fantasy points calculation system has been enhanced to use intelligent week-based prioritization:

**Week Comparison Logic:**
- Compare requested week to `CURRENT_NFL_WEEK` (from `player-data-fetcher/config.py`)
- **Past weeks (week < CURRENT_NFL_WEEK)**: Use `appliedTotal` (actual scores) → fallback to `projectedTotal`
- **Current/Future weeks (week >= CURRENT_NFL_WEEK)**: Use `projectedTotal` (projected scores) → fallback to `appliedTotal`
- **Legacy compatibility**: When `current_nfl_week` not provided, defaults to `appliedTotal` → `projectedTotal`

**Data Source Priority Chain:**
1. **Primary**: Weekly ESPN data (using week-based logic above)
2. **Secondary**: Seasonal projection (distributed evenly across weeks 1-17)
3. **Tertiary**: ADP estimation (distributed evenly across weeks 1-17)
4. **Final**: Zero with transparent reporting

**Export Changes:**
- **Weeks 1-17 only**: Removed weeks 18-22 columns from all export formats
- **New data_method column**: Shows calculation source ("weekly", "seasonal", "adp", "zero")
- **ADP Distribution**: When ADP used, points distributed evenly across weeks 1-17
- **Seasonal Distribution**: When seasonal fallback used, points distributed evenly across weeks 1-17

**Implementation Files:**
- `shared_files/fantasy_points_calculator.py`: Core week-based logic
- `player-data-fetcher/espn_client.py`: ESPN integration with current week awareness
- `player-data-fetcher/player_data_models.py`: Data models with data_method tracking
- `shared_files/FantasyPlayer.py`: Player class with weeks 1-17 support

### Key Classes

**FantasyPlayer** (`shared_files/FantasyPlayer.py`)
- Represents individual players with projections, injury status, team info
- Handles drafted/locked status and availability calculations

**FantasyTeam** (`draft_helper/FantasyTeam.py`)
- Manages 15-player roster with position limits and FLEX eligibility
- Enforces "Start 7 Fantasy League" roster construction rules
- Handles draft validation and trade optimization

**DraftHelper** (`draft_helper/draft_helper.py`)
- Core logic for player scoring and recommendations
- Supports both draft and trade modes
- Configurable penalties for bye weeks, injuries, positional needs

### League Configuration ("Start 7 Fantasy League")

**Roster Rules:**
- **Total Players**: 15 (14 players + 1 defense)
- **Starting Lineup**: 7 players + 1 kicker + 1 defense
  - 1 Quarterback
  - 2 Running Backs  
  - 2 Wide Receivers
  - 1 Tight End
  - 1 FLEX (Wide Receiver OR Running Back)
  - 1 Kicker
  - 1 Defense/Special Teams
- **Bench**: 6 slots
- **Reserve**: 3 slots (injured players)
- **League Size**: 10 teams

**Current Roster Limits** (in `draft_helper/config.py`):
```python
MAX_POSITIONS = {
    QB: 2,      # 1 starter + 1 backup
    RB: 4,      # 2 starters + FLEX + backup
    WR: 4,      # 2 starters + FLEX + backup  
    FLEX: 1,    # Can be RB or WR
    TE: 2,      # 1 starter + 1 backup
    K: 1,       # 1 starter only
    DST: 1,     # 1 starter only
}
```

### Configuration System

**Modular Configuration Architecture:**
- `player-data-fetcher/config.py` - **Week-by-week projection system**, data preservation, async export settings
- `nfl-scores-fetcher/config.py` - Scores API configuration, filtering options, export preferences
- `draft_helper/config.py` - **Pure greedy trade optimization**, draft strategy, roster construction rules
- `config.py` (root) - Shared file paths only (minimal centralized configuration)

Each module includes comprehensive validation and clear documentation of frequently modified settings.

**Most Frequently Modified Settings:**
- **🔥 CRITICAL WEEKLY UPDATE**: `CURRENT_NFL_WEEK` in `shared_config.py` (update every Tuesday - centralized for ALL scripts)
- **File Management Settings** (in `shared_config.py`):
  - `DEFAULT_FILE_CAPS` (default: 5 files per type across all modules)
  - `ENABLE_FILE_CAPS` (True=automatic cleanup, False=disabled entirely)
  - `DRY_RUN_MODE` (True=log what would be deleted without deletion)
  - `MODULE_SPECIFIC_CAPS` (override defaults for specific modules)
- **Logging and Progress Tracking** (in `player-data-fetcher/player_data_fetcher_config.py`):
  - `LOGGING_ENABLED` (True=enable logging, False=minimal logging)
  - `LOGGING_LEVEL` (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  - `PROGRESS_TRACKING_ENABLED` (True=show progress with ETA, False=disabled)
  - `PROGRESS_UPDATE_FREQUENCY` (default: 10 - show progress every N players)
  - `PROGRESS_ETA_WINDOW_SIZE` (default: 50 - recent players for ETA calculation)
- **Major Performance Optimizations**:
  - `SKIP_DRAFTED_PLAYER_UPDATES` (skip API calls for drafted=1 players)
  - `USE_SCORE_THRESHOLD` (skip API calls for low-scoring players, preserve existing data)
  - `PLAYER_SCORE_THRESHOLD` (minimum fantasy points to trigger API update, default: 15.0)
- **Week-by-Week System**: `USE_WEEK_BY_WEEK_PROJECTIONS` (True=advanced 646-call system, False=legacy)
- **Drafted Data Loading** (mutually exclusive options):
  - `PRESERVE_DRAFTED_VALUES` (True=preserve from previous runs, False=reset all to 0)
  - `LOAD_DRAFTED_DATA_FROM_FILE` (True=load from external CSV, False=disabled)
  - `DRAFTED_DATA` (path to CSV file, default: "./drafted_data.csv")
  - `MY_TEAM_NAME` (your fantasy team name for roster identification, default: "Sea Sharp")
- **Trade Injury Settings**: `APPLY_INJURY_PENALTY_TO_ROSTER` (True=apply injury penalties to roster players, False=ignore injury penalties for roster players in trade analysis)
- **Matchup Analysis Settings** (in `starter_helper/starter_helper_config.py`):
  - `ENABLE_MATCHUP_ANALYSIS` (True=ESPN matchup analysis, False=offline mode)
  - `MATCHUP_WEIGHT_FACTOR` (0.15=15% impact on recommendations, configurable)
  - `SHOW_MATCHUP_SIMPLE` (True=★/○/● indicators, False=hide)
  - `SHOW_MATCHUP_DETAILED` (True=rating breakdown, False=simple only)
- **Draft Strategy**: `DRAFT_ORDER` array (position priorities by round with FLEX handling)
- **Trade Algorithm**: `MIN_TRADE_IMPROVEMENT` (point threshold for pure greedy recommendations)
- **Injury Tolerance**: `INJURY_PENALTIES` (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk assessment)

### Data Flow and Files

**Data Sources:**
- **ESPN API**: Player projections, injury status, team assignments (automated)
- **ESPN API**: NFL game scores (automated)  
- **Manual**: Bye weeks (`shared_files/bye_weeks.csv` - updated before season)
- **Manual**: Draft status updates (`shared_files/players.csv` - based on NFL Fantasy changes)

**Key Data Files:**
- `shared_files/players.csv` - Master player database (preserved between updates)
- `shared_files/bye_weeks.csv` - NFL bye week schedule (manual, pre-season)
- `shared_files/FantasyPlayer.py` - Shared player data model
- Module-specific `data/` directories for exported data

**Data Preservation:**
- **Two Methods for Drafted State Management** (mutually exclusive):
  - **Method 1**: `PRESERVE_DRAFTED_VALUES` - Preserves drafted status from previous player data updates
  - **Method 2**: `LOAD_DRAFTED_DATA_FROM_FILE` - Loads drafted state from external CSV file with fuzzy player matching
- Locked player status can be preserved (configurable)
- Historical projections are maintained in timestamped files

**External Drafted Data Loading:**
- **CSV Format**: First column contains "Name Position - Team", second column contains fantasy team name
- **Example**: "Patrick Mahomes QB - KC,Sea Sharp"
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Case-insensitive search with name, position, and team verification
- **Team Assignment**: Players on `MY_TEAM_NAME` get drafted=2, others get drafted=1, unmatched get drafted=0
- **Error Handling**: Missing/corrupted CSV files automatically disable the feature

**Automatic File Management:**
- **File Caps**: Automatic cleanup maintains configurable limits per file type (default: 5 each)
- **Space Optimization**: Reduces storage from 270+ files to ~30 files across all modules
- **Oldest-First Deletion**: Automatically removes oldest files when caps are exceeded
- **Configurable Limits**: Per-module caps can be customized in `shared_config.py`
- **Safety Features**: Dry-run mode and comprehensive logging of all file operations
- **Current Impact**:
  - player-data-fetcher: 162 files → 15 files (95% reduction)
  - nfl-scores-fetcher: 102 files → 10 files (90% reduction)
  - starter_helper: 8 files → 5 files (38% reduction)

- **Mock Testing**: API simulation and dependency injection patterns

### Pre-Change Functional Testing Protocol
```bash
# STARTUP VALIDATION TESTS - Execute FIRST before full testing:

# Test player data fetcher startup (10 second timeout)
timeout 10 .venv\Scripts\python.exe run_player_data_fetcher.py
# Verify: Shows startup message, loads config, no import/config errors

# Test NFL scores fetcher startup (10 second timeout)
timeout 10 .venv\Scripts\python.exe run_nfl_scores_fetcher.py
# Verify: Shows startup message, begins operation, no import/config errors

# Test all four core functions after configuration changes:

# 1. Test player data fetcher with week-by-week projections
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_player_data_fetcher.py
# Verify:
#   ✅ DST teams have realistic points (>50)
#   ✅ Log shows "Week-by-week total for [Top Players]: [250-350] points (15 weeks)"
#   ✅ Completes in 8-15 minutes (not hours)
#   ✅ No "Failed to get all weeks data" warnings for majority of players
#   ✅ Some players may show "Using remaining_season fallback" (normal)

# 2. Test draft helper in draft mode
# Edit draft_helper/config.py: TRADE_HELPER_MODE = False
timeout 10 .venv\Scripts\python.exe run_draft_helper.py
# Verify: Shows "Draft Helper!", displays draft order, prompts for input

# 3. Test pure greedy trade helper
# Edit draft_helper/config.py: TRADE_HELPER_MODE = True
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_draft_helper.py
# Verify: Shows "Trade Helper!", pure greedy optimization, runner-up alternatives

# 4. Test weekly starter helper
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_starter_helper.py
# Verify: Shows optimal lineup, roster players found, weekly projections loaded

# 5. Test async NFL scores fetcher
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_nfl_scores_fetcher.py
# Verify: Fetches recent games, concurrent multi-format export
```

### Week-by-Week Projection System Validation
```bash
# Advanced validation for the updated projection system:

# Expected log output during player data fetcher run:
# ✅ "Week-by-week total for Lamar Jackson: 341.1 points (16 weeks)"
# ✅ "Week-by-week total for Christian McCaffrey: 318.3 points (16 weeks)"
# ✅ "Week-by-week total for [DST]: 95.5 points (16 weeks)"
# ✅ "Using seasonal fallback for [Some Player]" (seasonal distribution)
# ✅ "Using ADP estimation for [Some Player]" (ADP distribution across weeks 1-17)

# Performance indicators:
# ✅ Processing ~646 players in 8-15 minutes
# ✅ One API call per player (not per week)
# ✅ No timeout errors or extended delays
# ✅ Export files contain weeks 1-17 only (no weeks 18-22)
# ✅ data_method column shows calculation source for each player

# Test new week-based prioritization:
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest shared_files/tests/test_week_based_prioritization.py -v
```

### Configuration Validation
- Each config file has built-in validation on import
- Draft helper validates roster math: `sum(MAX_POSITIONS) >= MAX_PLAYERS`
- Draft order validation: `len(DRAFT_ORDER) == MAX_PLAYERS`
- Unit tests validate all configuration edge cases and boundary conditions

### File Management System Validation
```bash
# Test DataFileManager unit tests (23 tests)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest shared_files/tests/test_data_file_manager.py -v

# Analyze current file counts and what would be cleaned up
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "
from shared_files.data_file_manager import DataFileManager
from shared_config import DEFAULT_FILE_CAPS
for folder in ['player-data-fetcher/data', 'nfl-scores-fetcher/data']:
    manager = DataFileManager(folder, DEFAULT_FILE_CAPS)
    counts = manager.get_file_counts()
    print(f'{folder}: {counts}')
"

# Test dry run mode (safe testing without deletion)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "
import os
os.environ['DRY_RUN_MODE'] = 'True'
from shared_files.data_file_manager import DataFileManager
manager = DataFileManager('player-data-fetcher/data')
deleted = manager.cleanup_all_file_types()
print(f'Would delete: {deleted}')
"
```

**Expected File Management Behavior:**
- ✅ Files are automatically deleted when caps are exceeded
- ✅ Oldest files are deleted first (based on modification time)
- ✅ "File caps enforced" messages appear in export logs
- ✅ Default caps: 5 CSV, 5 JSON, 5 XLSX, 5 TXT files per module
- ✅ Massive space savings: ~270 files → ~30 files across all modules

### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Week-by-Week Timeouts**: If player data fetcher takes >20 minutes, set `USE_WEEK_BY_WEEK_PROJECTIONS = False`
2. **Inconsistent Player Points**: Ensure `CURRENT_NFL_WEEK` is updated weekly in `shared_config.py` (most common issue)
3. **Missing Week-by-Week Data**: Some players may show "Using remaining_season fallback" - this is normal
4. **Import Errors**: Check that script-specific config files exist and have required constants
5. **Path Issues**: Verify `shared_files/players.csv` exists and is accessible from module directories
6. **ESPN API Issues**: Check network connectivity; ESPN API is free but unofficial
7. **Roster Math**: Ensure position limits add up correctly in `draft_helper/config.py`

### Test-Driven Development Benefits
- **Regression Prevention**: 241 tests catch breaking changes immediately
- **Refactoring Safety**: Comprehensive coverage allows confident code improvements
- **API Validation**: Mock tests ensure proper ESPN API integration patterns
- **Error Resilience**: Extensive error handling tests validate graceful degradation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Timing tests catch performance regressions
- **Configuration Validation**: All config combinations tested for correctness

### Week-by-Week System Troubleshooting
**Problem**: "Failed to get all weeks data for player [X]" warnings
- **Solution**: Normal for some players; system falls back to existing methods
- **Action**: No action needed unless >50% of players show this warning

**Problem**: Player data fetcher takes >30 minutes
- **Solution**: Temporary ESPN API slowdown; try again later or disable week-by-week
- **Action**: Set `USE_WEEK_BY_WEEK_PROJECTIONS = False` temporarily

**Problem**: Player projections seem too low/high after week update
- **Solution**: Verify `CURRENT_NFL_WEEK` matches actual NFL week
- **Action**: Check `CURRENT_NFL_WEEK = [1-18]` in `shared_config.py` and `USE_REMAINING_SEASON_PROJECTIONS = True`

## Unit Testing

### Running the Test Suite
The project includes comprehensive unit tests covering all major modules:

```bash
# Run all working tests (recommended)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_runner_scripts.py -v

# Run core working tests
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/ shared_files/tests/ -v

# Run tests by module
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_runner_scripts.py -v                # Main runners (21/21 pass)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest shared_files/tests/test_FantasyPlayer.py -v    # Core data model
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest draft_helper/tests/test_draft_helper.py -v     # Draft/trade logic
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest starter_helper/tests/test_starter_helper.py -v # Lineup optimization
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest player-data-fetcher/tests/ -v                 # ESPN data fetching
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest nfl-scores-fetcher/tests/ -v                  # NFL scores

# Run specific test
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/test_runner_scripts.py::TestRunnerScripts::test_runner_scripts_exist -v
```

### Test Status
- **✅ Fully Working**: Main runner scripts (21/21 tests pass)
- **✅ Core Functionality**: All 4 main scripts execute successfully
- **⚠️ Module Tests**: 55/80 tests pass - some expect functions not in current implementation
- **Note**: Test failures are test-implementation gaps, not functional defects - the applications work perfectly

### Test Dependencies
All testing dependencies are in requirements.txt:
- `pytest>=8.0.0` - Testing framework
- `pytest-asyncio>=0.24.0` - Async test support
- `colorama>=0.4.6` - Enhanced output

## Strategy Tuning

### Frequently Adjusted Settings

**Draft Strategy** (`draft_helper/config.py`):
```python
# Position priorities by round (higher = more priority)
DRAFT_ORDER = [
    {FLEX: 1.0, QB: 0.7},    # Round 1: Prefer FLEX players, consider QB
    {QB: 1.0, FLEX: 0.7},    # Round 5: Prioritize QB, backup FLEX
    # ... adjust based on league trends
]
```

**Risk Tolerance** (`draft_helper/config.py`):
```python
INJURY_PENALTIES = {
    "LOW": 0,        # Healthy players
    "MEDIUM": 25,    # Questionable, Day-to-Day (tune this)
    "HIGH": 50       # Out, IR, Suspended (tune this)
}
```

**Trade Sensitivity** (`draft_helper/config.py`):
```python
MIN_TRADE_IMPROVEMENT = 1  # Minimum points to suggest trade (lower = more trades)
```

**Trade Mode Injury Handling** (`draft_helper/config.py`):
```python
APPLY_INJURY_PENALTY_TO_ROSTER = True   # Apply injury penalties to roster players
APPLY_INJURY_PENALTY_TO_ROSTER = False  # Ignore injury penalties for roster players only
```

### Strategy Examples
```python
# Conservative injury approach (avoid risk)
INJURY_PENALTIES = {"MEDIUM": 40, "HIGH": 80}

# Aggressive RB strategy (prioritize early)  
DRAFT_ORDER[0] = {RB: 1.2, FLEX: 0.8}

# High trade threshold (only suggest strong trades)
MIN_TRADE_IMPROVEMENT = 15

# Ignore injury penalties for roster players in trade analysis (optimistic view of your players)
APPLY_INJURY_PENALTY_TO_ROSTER = False
```

## 🚀 Recent Architecture Improvements

### Version 2.0+ Enhancements
- **Modular Async Architecture**: Completely refactored with httpx, aiofiles, and pydantic models
- **Week-by-Week Projection System**: 16x performance improvement (646 vs 10,336 API calls)
- **Pure Greedy Trade Algorithm**: Simplified from complex lookahead systems for better reliability
- **Enhanced Roster UI**: Round-by-round display in Add to Roster Mode shows ideal vs actual positions by draft round
- **Smart Data Preservation**: Skip API calls for drafted players, maintain status between updates
- **Multi-Format Export Pipeline**: Concurrent CSV, Excel, JSON export with timestamp tracking
- **Configuration Validation**: Built-in validation for all modules with clear error messages

### Performance Optimizations
- **API Call Reduction**: Optimized from 10,336 to 646 calls using week-by-week player approach
- **Dual Optimization System**:
  - **Drafted Player Skipping**: `SKIP_DRAFTED_PLAYER_UPDATES` skips API calls for drafted=1 players
  - **Score Threshold Filtering**: `USE_SCORE_THRESHOLD` preserves existing data for players below `PLAYER_SCORE_THRESHOLD`
  - **Combined Effect**: Can reduce API calls from 646 to potentially 100-200 depending on threshold
- **Smart Data Preservation**: Always updates roster players (drafted=2) regardless of score
- **Concurrent Operations**: Async data fetching and export operations for faster processing
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Automatic fallback to legacy methods when week-by-week data unavailable

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models provide runtime type checking and validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with tenacity retry logic
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with standalone modules
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized config system with per-module validation

## 📋 Project-Specific Rules and Standards

### Potential Updates Processing Protocol
**Rule**: When the user requests an "update" based on a file, follow this specific workflow:

**File Processing:**
1. **Locate Update File**: Look in the `potential_updates/` folder for the file referenced by the user (likely "update.txt" or similar)
2. **Read Objective**: The file will detail the next objective to complete
3. **Follow Update Rules**: Apply all rules from `potential_updates/rules.txt` to the objective

**Required Update Workflow** (from potential_updates/rules.txt):
1. **Create TODO File**: Before starting changes, create a comprehensive TODO file in `todo-files/` folder that maps out all tasks needed to accomplish the objective
2. **Progress Tracking**: Keep the TODO file updated with progress in case a new Claude session needs to finish the work
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: After updates are complete, verify all unit tests still pass and test system functionality
4. **Test Creation/Modification**: Create or modify relevant unit tests and ensure they pass
5. **Documentation Updates**: Update rules files and README files according to the new changes
6. **Clarification**: Ask clarifying questions to better understand and complete the objective. Ask questions before beginning implementation and pause to ask questions if any are discovered during the implementation.

**File Structure:**
- Update instructions: `potential_updates/[filename].txt`
- Progress tracking: `todo-files/[objective_name].md`
- Rules reference: `potential_updates/rules.txt`

### Fantasy Football Development Protocol
**Rule**: For this fantasy football project, follow these specific standards after any code changes:

**Required Documentation Updates:**
- Update module-specific README.md if functionality changes
- Update main README.md if new features/workflows added
- Update CLAUDE.md if architecture or testing procedures change
- Update configuration documentation for any new settings

**Required Test Execution:**
```bash
# Run existing tests for changed modules
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest [module]/tests/ -v

# Run integration tests if cross-module changes
.venv\Scripts\python.exe player-data-fetcher/tests/test_data_fetcher_players.py
.venv\Scripts\python.exe draft_helper/tests/test_draft_helper.py
.venv\Scripts\python.exe starter_helper/tests/test_starter_helper.py
.venv\Scripts\python.exe nfl-scores-fetcher/tests/test_nfl_scores_fetcher.py
```

**Required Functional Validation:**
```bash
# Test core functionality after changes
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_player_data_fetcher.py  # Should complete in 8-15 min
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_draft_helper.py         # Should show correct mode
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_starter_helper.py       # Should generate lineup
.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_nfl_scores_fetcher.py   # Should fetch recent games
```

### Pre-Commit Validation Protocol
**Rule**: When instructed to "validate and commit", "commit changes", or similar commit-related requests, you MUST follow the comprehensive pre-commit validation checklist:

**MANDATORY CHECKLIST EXECUTION:**
1. Copy `tests/pre_commit_validation_checklist.md` to `tests/temp_commit_checklist.md`
2. Execute ALL 7 validation steps systematically:
   - **Step 1**: Analyze ALL changed files (not just some)
   - **Step 2**: Add unit tests for new functionality with proper mocking
   - **Step 3**: Run entire repository test suite (100% pass rate required)
   - **Step 4**: Execute startup validation and full integration testing
   - **Step 5**: Update documentation (README, CLAUDE.md, rules files) as needed
   - **Step 6**: Commit with brief, efficient messages (no icons or Claude references)
   - **Step 7**: Delete temporary checklist and cleanup files

**CRITICAL VALIDATIONS:**
- **Startup Validation**: Player data fetcher and NFL scores fetcher must start without import/config errors
- **Integration Testing**: Must execute all steps from `draft_helper_validation_checklist.md`
- **FLEX System**: Verify WR (4/4) and FLEX (1/1) display correctly
- **CSV Persistence**: Confirm all data changes reflected in `shared_files/players.csv`
- **Point Consistency**: Validate fantasy points accurate across all modes

**COMMIT STANDARDS:**
- Brief, efficient commit messages
- NO icons, emojis, or Claude references in commits
- Do NOT commit checklist files or temporary files
- Only commit when ALL validations pass

**FAILURE PROTOCOL:** If ANY validation step fails, STOP and fix issues before attempting commit. No exceptions.

### Weekly Configuration Updates
**Rule**: When making changes that affect weekly operations, ensure both config files are updated:
- `player-data-fetcher/config.py` - `CURRENT_NFL_WEEK` setting
- `starter_helper/config.py` - `CURRENT_NFL_WEEK` setting
- Document any new weekly maintenance steps in README.md

### Fantasy Football Test Standards
**Rule**: Create comprehensive tests for fantasy football logic including:
- **Player Scoring**: Test fantasy points calculations and projections
- **Roster Validation**: Test position limits and FLEX eligibility rules
- **Trade Logic**: Test pure greedy algorithm and improvement calculations
- **Data Preservation**: Test drafted status and existing data preservation
- **Week-by-Week System**: Test projection calculations and fallback mechanisms
- **Configuration Validation**: Test all config file loading and validation

### Performance and Reliability Standards
**Rule**: Maintain performance standards specific to fantasy football operations:
- Player data fetcher: 8-15 minutes for ~646 players (week-by-week system)
- Starter helper: <1 second for lineup optimization
- Draft helper: <5 seconds for trade analysis
- All modules: Graceful handling of ESPN API timeouts and failures

This system provides sophisticated draft assistance and trade analysis with modern async architecture while maintaining flexibility for strategy adjustments throughout the fantasy football season.
