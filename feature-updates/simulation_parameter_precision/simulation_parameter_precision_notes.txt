For each parameter in the simulation, I want to specifiy what precision the random values should be
This would be configured in PARAM_DEFINITIONS
The precision of the random values should equal the precision that it set by the min and max values
If the min and max values have different precision levels, then use whichever level is more minute

Example:
PARAM_DEFINITIONS = {
    'NORMALIZATION_MAX_SCALE': (100, 175),
    'SAME_POS_BYE_WEIGHT': (0.00, 0.50),
    ...
}
NORMALIZATION_MAX_SCALE would have random values generated from the set [100, 101, 102, ..., 173, 174, 175]
SAME_POS_BYE_WEIGHT would have random values generated from the set [0.00, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.48, 0.49, 0.50]
etc.

If there are less possible configurations in the set than what the test-values argument for the simulation script is set for, then it would just test however many possible configurations are in the set.
