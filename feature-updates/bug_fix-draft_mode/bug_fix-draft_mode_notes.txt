Add to Roster mode in the league helper is fundamentally broken
When it loads, it should assign each player currently rostered to the user's team to a 'Round'. There are 15 rounds, each corresponding to an entry in the DRAFT_ORDER array.
It should iterate through the rostered players, and then for each player it should find the first entry in the DRAFT_ORDER array whose 'P' value corresponds to the player's position, then it will assign the player to that 'round'
After assigning all players to rounds, then it should determine which rounds from 1-15 still don't have a player that can be assigned to it. The earliest round that does not have a player will be what is considered the current 'round'
The Add to Roster mode should then look for the best available players while setting the previously determined round as the current round

This is what is shown in the Add to Roster mode based on the current player data:

Current Roster by Draft Round:
--------------------------------------------------
Round  1 (Ideal: WR  ): [EMPTY SLOT]
Round  2 (Ideal: WR  ): [EMPTY SLOT]
Round  3 (Ideal: TE  ): Dalton Schultz (TE) - 133.7 pts
Round  4 (Ideal: WR  ): [EMPTY SLOT]
Round  5 (Ideal: QB  ): Trevor Lawrence (QB) - 154.3 pts
Round  6 (Ideal: TE  ): Brenton Strange (TE) - 77.7 pts
Round  7 (Ideal: RB  ): [EMPTY SLOT]
Round  8 (Ideal: QB  ): C.J. Stroud (QB) - 266.9 pts
Round  9 (Ideal: RB  ): [EMPTY SLOT]
Round 10 (Ideal: RB  ): [EMPTY SLOT]
Round 11 (Ideal: WR  ): [EMPTY SLOT]
Round 12 (Ideal: RB  ): [EMPTY SLOT]
Round 13 (Ideal: K   ): Cam Little (K) - 119.3 pts
Round 14 (Ideal: DST ): Texans D/ST (DST) - 101.8 pts
Round 15 (Ideal: FLEX): Ashton Jeanty (RB) - 259.8 pts


This is not correct. It should be assigning all 15 rostered players to rounds, but there are a ton of empty spots for WR and RB. I believe the issue lies somewhere in the way we assess FLEX
