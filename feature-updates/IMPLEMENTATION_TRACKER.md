## Notes and Decisions

### Design Decisions
1. **Post-approval spec changes (Issue #47):** Documented as intentional design. Changes are alignment fixes (not scope changes). User reviews updated specs at Gate 4.5 before S4 starts.

### Implementation Notes
- **Phase 2 execution order matters:** Proposal 6 (new S4) before Proposal 5 (S3 redesign) so old S4 content is available for S3.P1
- **Commit after each phase:** Allows rollback if issues discovered
- **Track time spent:** Compare actual vs estimated (19-30h total)

### Lessons Learned (Add during implementation)
- (To be filled in as implementation progresses)
