I want to create one more simulation runner script
I want the script to:
Loop through every draft_order_possibilities json file
For each file, it performs a full iterative simulation and produces an optimal_* folder
We will have dedicated folders for the simulation_configs for each draft_order_possibilities file. These would be simulation/simulation_configs/0_MINE, simulation/simulation_configs/1_zero_rb, etc
If a folder hasn't been created yet when we get to the json file, then the script should create a new one and copy over the latest optimal_* files from the root simulation/simulation_configs directory
The script should use all of the same optimizations as run_simulation.py has including the --use-processes flag
There should be a corresponding Bash .sh script that starts up the simulation and restarts it if it crashes just like the ./run_simulation_loop.sh file
When the script starts, it should be able to detect which json file was left off at, and which parameter within it was left off at
The script should endlessly loop through the draft_order_possibilities json files until the user interrupts it
The script should define the same constants at the top of the file as what is used by run_simulation.py to define settings like workers and sim counts
