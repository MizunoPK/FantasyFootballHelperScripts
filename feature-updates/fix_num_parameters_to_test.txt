The NUM_PARAMETERS_TO_TEST settings in both win rate and accuracy simulations had previously been depreciated during updates, but I now want to get them working again

The NUM_PARAMETERS_TO_TEST setting should determine how many parameters to get random values for during a simulation run. Whenever it is greater than 1, then for each value above one it will pick a random config parameter (in addition to the one that is up next in the PARAMETER_ORDER) and will generate random config values for that parameter and set up combinations between those random config values and the other ones generated for other configs.

This is designed to see how parameters interact with each other and affect the end product when changed together
