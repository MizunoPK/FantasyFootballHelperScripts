draft mode in the league helper is fundamentally broken
When it loads, it should assign each player currently rostered to the user's team to a 'Round'. There are 15 rounds, each corresponding to an entry in the DRAFT_ORDER array.
It should iterate through the rostered players, and then for each player it should find the first entry in the DRAFT_ORDER array whose 'P' value corresponds to the player's position, then it will assign the player to that 'round'
After assigning all players to rounds, then it should determine which rounds from 1-15 still don't have a player that can be assigned to it. The earliest round that does not have a player will be what is considered the current 'round'
The draft mode should then look for the best available players while setting the previously determined round as the current round
