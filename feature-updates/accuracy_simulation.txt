Going to make a new version of the simulation that is testing accuracy instead of win rate
The Accuracy Simulation will loop through config parameters iteratively in the same way as the Win Rate simulation
Instead of simulating drafts and matches, the Accuracy simulation will loop through every player and score them to determine a 'calculated projected points' value. The calculated projected points will be compared to the actual points scored by the player to determine how accurate the scoring method was.
First, the simulation will do this to determine season-long projections using the same scoring method as what is used by the Draft Mode, and will compare the total season-long projection to what the player actually scored over the course of the season
Then, the simulation will loop through every week in the season and determine what weekly projection it would assign each player and compare that to the actual score of the player.
The calculated projected points should be found through the score_player calls and un-doing the point normalization
In the same way as the Win Rate simulation, the config that was the most accurate for a certain week range will be associated with the corrsponding week-specific config file as the ideal config for those weeks 
We're going to refactor the simulation folder to have all the shared classes between the two types of simulation in the root of the simulation folder, and all the win-rate sim specific classes moved to a dedicated folder, and have all the accuracy-sim specific classes moved to a dedicated folder
run_simulation.py and run_simulation_loop.sh should be renamed to run_win_rate_simulation.py and run_win_rate_simulation_loop.sh
New run_accuracy_simulation.py and run_accuracy_simulation_loop.sh files should be created in the same vein as the win rate versions
