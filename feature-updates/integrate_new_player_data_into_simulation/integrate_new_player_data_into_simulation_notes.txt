A recent effort updated the league helper to no longer use players.csv and players_projected.csv to instead use a player_data folder with positional json files - this epic will be about updating the Simulation module to accomidate those changes
Both the Win Rate sim and Accuracy Sim should maintain the same functionality as before they were broken by the json file introduction, but now it will access data a bit differently
Both Win Rate Sim and Accuracy Sim should:
- No longer try to load in players.csv or players_projected.csv
- Correctly load in the json files contained in the week_X folders
- Correctly accomidate the changes to the drafted_by, locked, projected_points, and actual_points fields

Additionally, I want to verify if Week 17 is being correctly assessed in both sims. When running score_player calculations, it should use the week_17 folders to determine a projected_points of the player, then it should look at the actual_points array in week_18 folders to determine what the player actually scored in week 17
