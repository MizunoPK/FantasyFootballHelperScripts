┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🎯 TARGET: Confidence Score ≥ 80%                              │
│                                                                  │
│  Required for exit (Stage 5 Criterion 7):                       │
│  • Self-assessed using scoring rubric (this guide)              │
│  • No red flags present                                         │
│  • Feel genuinely complete (not just wanting to finish)         │
│                                                                  │

### Quick Self-Assessment

**Ask yourself:**
1. Did I check ALL 17 dimensions across all 4 sub-rounds? (Yes/No)
2. Did I use 5+ different pattern types across rounds? (Yes/No)
3. Did I manually read 10+ random files per sub-round? (Yes/No)
4. Did I find ZERO new issues in latest round (all 4 sub-rounds)? (Yes/No)
5. Do I feel certain I didn't miss anything obvious? (Yes/No)

**If ANY answer is "No" → Confidence <80% → Must loop**

## Confidence Scoring Formula

### Overall Formula

```text
Confidence Score = (Coverage × Rigor × Verification × Consistency) × 100%

Where each component ranges from 0.0 to 1.0
```

### Component Weights

| Component | Description | Weight in Formula |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Coverage** | Completeness of search scope | 25% (multiply by all) |
| **Rigor** | Thoroughness of validation | 25% (multiply by all) |
| **Verification** | Quality of fix validation | 25% (multiply by all) |
| **Consistency** | Pattern diversity across rounds | 25% (multiply by all) |

**Note:** Multiplicative formula means weakness in ANY area significantly reduces overall score.

## Red Flags

### Automatic Confidence Reduction

**If ANY of these are true, reduce confidence by 20 percentage points:**

🚩 **Round Count <3:** Minimum rounds not met
🚩 **N_new > 0:** New issues introduced by fixes
🚩 **User Challenged:** User expressed doubt at any point
🚩 **Root Files Skipped:** README.md, EPIC_WORKFLOW_USAGE.md, prompts_reference_v2.md not checked
🚩 **Sub-Round Skipped:** Did not complete all 4 sub-rounds
🚩 **Pattern Diversity <3:** Used fewer than 3 different pattern types
🚩 **No Manual Reading:** Relied entirely on automated grep
🚩 **Working from Memory:** Didn't re-read files in later rounds
🚩 **Feeling Rushed:** Want to finish quickly rather than genuinely complete

**Example:**
```text
Calculated Score: 85%
Red Flags Present: 2 (User challenged, Pattern diversity <3)
Final Score: 85% - (2 × 20%) = 45%
Conclusion: MUST LOOP (< 80% threshold)
```

## Confidence Levels

### 90-100%: Very High Confidence

**Characteristics:**
- All 4 components ≥ 0.9
- Zero red flags
- Comprehensive coverage
- Extreme rigor
- Complete verification
- Excellent pattern diversity

**Can Exit?** ✅ YES (exceeds threshold)

**Example:**
```text
Coverage: 1.0 (all 17 dimensions, all directories, root files)
Rigor: 0.95 (6 pattern types, automated + manual, deep context analysis)
Verification: 0.95 (all patterns re-run, new variations, extensive spot-checks)
Consistency: 1.0 (5+ pattern types across rounds, fresh eyes each round)

Score: 1.0 × 0.95 × 0.95 × 1.0 = 0.90 = 90%
```

---

### 80-89%: High Confidence

**Characteristics:**
- All 4 components ≥ 0.8
- Zero or one minor red flag
- Complete coverage
- High rigor
- Thorough verification
- Good pattern diversity

**Can Exit?** ✅ YES (meets threshold)

**Example:**
```text
Coverage: 1.0 (all dimensions, all directories)
Rigor: 0.8 (4 pattern types, automated + some manual)
Verification: 0.85 (most patterns re-run, some new variations)
Consistency: 0.8 (4 pattern types across rounds, mostly fresh eyes)

Score: 1.0 × 0.8 × 0.85 × 0.8 = 0.54 → 54% base
No red flags: 54% final

Wait - this example shows how multiplicative formula reduces score!
Need to recalculate with better component scores to hit 80%:

Coverage: 1.0
Rigor: 0.90
Verification: 0.90
Consistency: 1.0

Score: 1.0 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 1.0 = 0.81 = 81% ✅
```

---

### 65-79%: Medium Confidence

**Characteristics:**
- Some components <0.8
- One or two red flags
- Partial coverage OR moderate rigor
- Adequate verification
- Fair pattern diversity

**Can Exit?** ❌ NO (below threshold)

**Must:** Loop for at least one more round

---

### 50-64%: Low Confidence

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple components <0.7
- Multiple red flags
- Incomplete coverage
- Low rigor
- Insufficient verification

**Can Exit?** ❌ NO (significantly below threshold)

**Must:** Loop for 2+ more rounds with improved methodology

---

### <50%: Very Low Confidence

**Characteristics:**
- Most components <0.6
- Many red flags
- Minimal coverage
- Minimal rigor
- Minimal verification

**Can Exit?** ❌ NO (unacceptable)

**Must:** Restart audit with different approach

---

## Exit Threshold

### The 80% Rule

**Why 80%?**
- Balances thoroughness with practical completion
- High enough to ensure quality
- Achievable without perfectionism
- Based on historical audit data

**Historical Evidence:**
- Audits scoring <80%: Found 30+ additional issues in next round
- Audits scoring ≥80%: Found <5 issues in next round (mostly false positives)
- User challenges: 100% correlated with confidence <75%

### Calculating Your Score

**Step 1: Score Each Component (0.0 to 1.0)**
```text
Coverage Score: _____
Rigor Score: _____
Verification Score: _____
Consistency Score: _____
```

**Step 2: Calculate Base Score**
```text
Base Score = Coverage × Rigor × Verification × Consistency × 100%
Base Score = _____ %
```

**Step 3: Apply Red Flag Penalties**
```text
Red Flags Present: [List all that apply]
Count: _____ flags
Penalty: _____ × 20% = _____ %
```

**Step 4: Final Score**
```text
Final Score = Base Score - Penalty
Final Score = _____ %
```

**Step 5: Compare to Threshold**
```text
Exit Threshold: 80%
Your Score: _____ %

Decision:
[ ] ≥80% → Can exit (if all other criteria met)
[ ] <80% → Must loop
```

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Strong Audit (Can Exit)

```text
Coverage: 1.0 (all 17 dimensions, all directories, root files checked)
Rigor: 0.9 (5 pattern types, automated + manual, thorough context analysis)
Verification: 0.9 (all patterns re-run, new variations, N_new=0)
Consistency: 0.95 (fresh eyes, different patterns each round)

Base Score: 1.0 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.95 = 0.7695 = 77%
Red Flags: None
Penalty: 0%

Final Score: 77% + 0% = 77%... wait, that's <80%!

This shows multiplicative formula is strict. To hit 80%, need:
Coverage: 1.0, Rigor: 0.95, Verification: 0.9, Consistency: 0.95
1.0 × 0.95 × 0.9 × 0.95 = 0.81 = 81% ✅
```

### Example 2: Weak Audit (Must Loop)

```text
Coverage: 0.8 (skipped root files)
Rigor: 0.7 (only 3 pattern types, no manual reading)
Verification: 0.7 (didn't re-run all patterns)
Consistency: 0.6 (same search order, relied on memory)

Base Score: 0.8 × 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.6 = 0.24 = 24%
Red Flags: Root Files Skipped (-20%), Pattern Diversity <3 (-20%)
Penalty: 40%

Final Score: 24% - 40% = 0% (floor at 0)
Decision: MUST LOOP ❌
```
