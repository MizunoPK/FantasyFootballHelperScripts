**If FAIL:** Issues remain unfixed, must continue fixing (cannot proceed to next round)

---

### ✅ / ❌ Criterion 4: Minimum Rounds

- [ ] Completed at least 3 rounds with fresh eyes

- [ ] Stage 1 Discovery found ZERO issues
- [ ] Comprehensive search patterns used (5+ types)
- [ ] All folders checked systematically
- [ ] Fresh perspective applied (not same patterns as Round N-1)

**Status:** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

**Evidence:**
- Issues found in Round [N] Stage 1: [N]
- Search patterns used: [List pattern types]

- [ ] All original patterns re-run cleanly
- [ ] Pattern variations tried (5+ new variations)
- [ ] Spot-checks found no issues (10+ files)

**Status:** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL

**Evidence:**

- Tier 1 (re-run): [Clean/Issues]
- Tier 2 (variations): [Clean/Issues]

## Decision Rationale

### Why EXIT / Why LOOP

**[Choose one path below based on criteria results]**

---

### ✅ EXIT DECISION

**All 9 exit criteria passed + user approved.**

**Rationale:**
- [Criterion-by-criterion evidence]
- [Why confident this audit is complete]
- [What gives high confidence]

**Evidence of Thoroughness:**
- Rounds completed: [N] (≥ 3)
- Total issues found across all rounds: [Sum N_found from all rounds]
- Total issues fixed: [Sum N_fixed from all rounds]
- Final verification: N_new = 0 (clean)
- User review: Approved without challenge

**Historical Comparison:**
- KAI-7 audit: 4 rounds, 104+ fixes
- This audit: [N] rounds, [N] fixes
- Coverage level: [Comparable / More thorough / Less thorough]

**Next Steps:**
1. Present results to user for final approval
2. Commit all audit fixes with detailed message
3. Update AUDIT_CREATION_STATUS.md or other tracking
4. Mark audit as complete

---

### 🔄 LOOP DECISION

**Failed [N] of 9 exit criteria. Must continue to Round [N+1].**

**Failed Criteria:**
1. [Criterion X]: [Why it failed]
2. [Criterion Y]: [Why it failed]
3. [Additional failures if any]

**What This Means:**
- [Interpretation of failures]
- [What was missed or incomplete]
- [Why another round is needed]

**Historical Context:**
- Premature exit claims in KAI-7: 3 times
- Each time: 50+ more issues found
- Better to continue than risk incompleteness

**Next Steps - Round [N+1] Preparation:**

**1. Fresh Eyes Strategy:**
- [ ] Take 5-10 minute break (clear mental context)
- [ ] Close all files from Round [N]
- [ ] Do NOT look at Round [N] discoveries until after Round [N+1] Stage 1 complete
- [ ] Approach as if first time seeing codebase

**2. New Search Patterns:**
- [ ] List new pattern variations to try (different from Round [N])
- [ ] Target areas that may have been missed
- [ ] Consider different dimension focus

**New patterns to try:**
- [Pattern 1]: [Example]
- [Pattern 2]: [Example]
- [Pattern 3]: [Example]

**3. Different Search Order:**
- Round [N] order: [List folders checked in order]
- Round [N+1] order: [Different order planned]

**4. Focus Areas:**
Based on what was found (or not found) in Round [N], focus on:
- [Focus Area 1]: [Why]
- [Focus Area 2]: [Why]
- [Focus Area 3]: [Why]

**Start Round [N+1] with:** `stages/stage_1_discovery.md`

- User Presentation

**Optional Sections:**
- Round Statistics (helpful for tracking)
- Appendices (helpful for transparency)

### How to Fill This Out

**Step 1:** Fill metadata (date, round, duration)

**Step 2:** Assess each of 9 exit criteria systematically
- Check all sub-requirements
- Provide evidence for each
- Mark ✅ PASS or ❌ FAIL

**Step 3:** Complete Exit Criteria Summary table

**Step 4:** Choose decision path:
- All 9 ✅ = EXIT path
- Any ❌ = LOOP path

**Step 5:** Fill appropriate rationale section (EXIT or LOOP)

**Step 6:** Prepare user presentation summary

**Step 7:** Get user approval before proceeding

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Claiming exit with < 3 rounds**
- Criterion 4 automatically fails if Round < 3

❌ **Claiming exit with N_new > 0**
- Criterion 3 automatically fails if new issues found

❌ **Ignoring low confidence**
- Confidence < 80% = insufficient coverage

❌ **Not documenting N_remaining**
- All remaining instances must have rationale

❌ **Proceeding without user approval**
- User must review and approve exit decision

---

**After completing this template:**
- Present summary to user
- Get explicit approval for EXIT or acknowledgment for LOOP
- If EXIT: Commit and complete
- If LOOP: Start Round [N+1] Stage 1 with fresh eyes
