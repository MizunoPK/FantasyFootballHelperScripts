Bug Fix: Phase Out drafted Field in Favor of drafted_by

BACKGROUND:
During Sub-feature 7 TODO verification (Iteration 1), we discovered that the drafted_by field was missing from FantasyPlayer. This was added as a quick fix to unblock Sub-feature 7, but now we have TWO fields tracking the same information:
- drafted: int (0=free agent, 1=opponent team, 2=our team) - LEGACY
- drafted_by: str (""=free agent, "Team Name"=opponent, "Sea Sharp"=our team) - NEW

The original notes (integrate_new_player_data_into_league_helper_notes.txt:6-13) explicitly stated:
"Note that the drafted column from the csv has turned into a drafted_by column that has the team name."

This means we should be using ONLY drafted_by, not maintaining both fields.

OBJECTIVE:
Phase out the drafted field entirely and migrate all code to use drafted_by with helper methods for readability.

SCOPE:
1. Add 3 helper methods to FantasyPlayer:
   - is_free_agent() -> bool  (replaces: player.drafted == 0)
   - is_drafted_by_opponent() -> bool  (replaces: player.drafted == 1)
   - is_rostered() -> bool  (replaces: player.drafted == 2)

2. Search codebase for all uses of player.drafted:
   - Replace comparisons with helper method calls
   - Document all locations found

3. Update all code that SETS player.drafted to instead set player.drafted_by:
   - Setting to 0 → set drafted_by = ""
   - Setting to 2 → set drafted_by = FANTASY_TEAM_NAME
   - Setting to 1 → set drafted_by = <opponent team name>

4. Mark drafted field as deprecated:
   - Add deprecation warning in FantasyPlayer docstring
   - Keep field for backward compatibility (don't remove yet)
   - Set via property that derives from drafted_by

5. Update from_json() and from_dict():
   - Stop populating drafted field directly
   - Derive drafted from drafted_by using helper logic

6. Testing:
   - Verify all comparisons work with helper methods
   - Verify all setters work with drafted_by
   - Run full test suite (100% pass required)
   - Add tests for helper methods

BENEFITS:
- Single source of truth (drafted_by)
- Cleaner API (helper methods more readable than magic numbers)
- Matches original design intent from notes
- Eliminates synchronization issues between two fields
- Team names preserved (no data loss)

RISKS:
- Moderate impact (need to search entire codebase for drafted usage)
- Could break simulation module if it uses drafted field (verify first)
- Need careful testing to ensure no regressions

MIGRATION STRATEGY:
- Phase 1: Add helper methods, keep both fields (backward compatible)
- Phase 2: Migrate all comparisons to helper methods
- Phase 3: Migrate all setters to drafted_by
- Phase 4: Deprecate drafted field (property that derives from drafted_by)
- Future: Remove drafted field entirely in breaking change release

DEPENDENCIES:
- Requires Sub-feature 7 completion (uses drafted_by field we just added)
- Should be done BEFORE Sub-feature 8 (CSV Deprecation) to avoid having to update deprecated code

PRIORITY: HIGH (prevents technical debt from accumulating)
