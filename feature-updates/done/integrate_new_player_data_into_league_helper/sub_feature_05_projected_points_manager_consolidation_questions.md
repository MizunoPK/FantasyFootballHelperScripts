# Sub-Feature 5: ProjectedPointsManager Consolidation - Questions

**Status:** No questions identified

## Summary

During TODO creation (24 iterations), the following verification was completed:

**Round 1 (Iterations 1-7):**
- ✅ Draft TODO created from spec
- ✅ All files verified to exist
- ✅ Error handling patterns identified
- ✅ Algorithm Traceability Matrix created (100% coverage)
- ✅ TODO Specification Audit passed (all tasks have acceptance criteria)
- ✅ End-to-end data flow traced
- ✅ Skeptical re-verification completed (all assumptions verified)
- ✅ Integration gap check completed (no gaps found)

**Findings:**
- All spec requirements are clear and unambiguous
- Dependencies satisfied (Sub-features 1 and 2 complete)
- Integration points documented
- Only 1 production caller (player_scoring.py) verified
- Test files use mocks (no additional callers)
- No ambiguities or missing information

**Conclusion:** Implementation can proceed without user clarification.
