Feature Request: Comprehensive ESPN API Documentation & Research

**Created:** 2025-12-22
**Priority:** HIGH (Blocking accurate feature implementation)
**Type:** Research & Documentation
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks (thorough research + documentation)

## Executive Summary

Recent testing revealed that existing ESPN API documentation is incomplete and contains inaccuracies. Critical stat IDs (targets, carries) were incorrectly documented as "unavailable" when they actually exist in the API response. This feature request involves conducting comprehensive research into ALL ESPN API endpoints, mapping undocumented stat IDs, and creating authoritative documentation to replace the deprecated docs.

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents wasted effort on unnecessary workarounds (e.g., PFR scraping for data already in ESPN API)
- Enables accurate feature implementation decisions
- Provides reliable reference for future development
- Documents undocumented stat IDs that ESPN doesn't publish

**Scope:**
1. Test ALL ESPN API endpoints used in player-data-fetcher
2. Map ALL stat IDs in the stats{} object (40+ stat IDs exist)
3. Document exact response structures with examples
4. Create comprehensive reference documentation
5. Mark old docs as deprecated
6. Validate findings with cross-references to known NFL stats

## 1. Research Scope & Methodology

### Endpoints to Document

#### 1.1 Player Stats Endpoint (CRITICAL)

**URL:**
```
GET https://lm-api-reads.fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{SEASON}/segments/0/leaguedefaults/{PPR_ID}
```

**Parameters to Test:**
- `view=kona_player_info` (player data view)
- `scoringPeriodId=0` (season totals)
- `scoringPeriodId=1-18` (specific weeks)
- `X-Fantasy-Filter` (player limits, sorting, filters)

**What to Document:**
- Complete stats{} object with ALL stat IDs mapped
- statSourceId meanings (0=actuals, 1=projections)
- seasonId, scoringPeriodId, appliedTotal fields
- Rankings structure (rankings{}, draftRanksByRankType{})
- Ownership data (averageDraftPosition, percentOwned)
- Injury status values and meanings
- Team ID mappings (proTeamId to abbreviations)
- Position ID mappings (defaultPositionId to position names)

**Stat IDs to Map (Confirmed + Unknown):**

| Category | Known Stat IDs | Unknown Stat IDs (Need Research) |
|----------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Rushing** | 23 (carries), 24 (yards) | 25, 26, 27-31, 33-34 |
| **Receiving** | 42 (yards), 53 (receptions), 58 (targets) | 43-51, 54-57, 59-61 |
| **Passing** | 41 (completions?), 43 (TDs?) | 44-46 |
| **Scoring** | 47-52 (TD types?) | All need confirmation |
| **Defense/Special** | Unknown | 67-68, 71-73 |
| **Fantasy Breakdown** | 60 (component?), 156, 158, 210, 213 | All need research |

**Testing Method:**
1. Query Week 15 actuals for top 100 players across all positions
2. Cross-reference stat values with known NFL.com stats for same week
3. Identify stat IDs by pattern matching (e.g., completions < attempts)
4. Validate across multiple players to confirm consistency

#### 1.2 Scoreboard Endpoint

**URL:**
```
GET https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard
```

**Parameters to Test:**
- `seasontype=2` (regular season)
- `week=1-18` (week numbers)
- `dates={SEASON}` (season year)

**What to Document:**
- Game structure (events[], competitions[])
- Team data (competitors[], team{})
- Venue data (venue{}, address{}, indoor flag)
- Status data (status{}, completed flag)
- Scores (score, linescores[])
- Broadcasts (broadcasts[], geoBroadcasts[])
- **CONFIRMED NOT AVAILABLE:** odds[], spread, over/under (document absence)

**Testing Method:**
1. Query Week 16 games (mix of completed/in-progress/scheduled)
2. Document all available fields
3. Recursively search for any betting-related keywords
4. Confirm absence of odds data with multiple weeks

#### 1.3 Team Stats Endpoint

**URL:**
```
GET https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/teams/{TEAM_ID}/statistics
```

**What to Document:**
- Team stat categories (passing, rushing, receiving, defense)
- Individual stat names and values
- Aggregation types (per game, season totals, per play)
- Update frequency (live vs daily updates)
- Team ID to abbreviation mappings (1-34)

**Testing Method:**
1. Query all 32 NFL teams
2. Document complete stat structure
3. Identify which stats are useful for fantasy projections
4. Cross-reference with scoreboard data for consistency

#### 1.4 Team Roster Endpoint (If Exists)

**Research Question:** Does ESPN provide team roster data?

**Potential URLs to Test:**
```
GET https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/teams/{TEAM_ID}/roster
GET https://lm-api-reads.fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{SEASON}/teams/{TEAM_ID}
```

**What to Document (If Available):**
- Active roster vs practice squad
- Injury designations
- Depth chart positions
- Snap count percentages

---

## 2. Stat ID Mapping Methodology

### 2.1 Cross-Reference with Known Stats

**Approach:**
For each unknown stat ID, cross-reference with NFL.com official stats for the same player/week.

**Example Process:**
```
Player: Amon-Ra St. Brown, Week 15, 2024
ESPN stat_58: 18.0
ESPN stat_53: 14.0
ESPN stat_42: 193.0

NFL.com Week 15 Stats:
- Targets: 18 ✅ Matches stat_58
- Receptions: 14 ✅ Matches stat_53
- Receiving Yards: 193 ✅ Matches stat_42
```

### 2.2 Pattern Recognition

**Validation Rules:**

| Stat Relationship | Validation |
|-------------------|------------|
| Targets >= Receptions | For WR/TE/RB receiving |
| Pass Attempts >= Completions | For QB passing |
| Carries > 0 → Yards > 0 | For RB rushing (usually) |
| Receptions × ~10 ≈ Yards | For WR (rough estimate) |
| TDs <= Scores | Total TDs can't exceed scoring plays |

### 2.3 Position-Specific Stats

**By Position:**

| Position | Expected Stats | Stat IDs to Find |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **QB** | Pass attempts, completions, pass yards, pass TDs, INTs, rush attempts, rush yards, rush TDs, sacks | Need to identify all |
| **RB** | Rush attempts (23 ✅), rush yards (24 ✅), rush TDs, targets (58 ✅), receptions (53 ✅), rec yards (42 ✅), rec TDs, fumbles | Need rush TDs, fumbles |
| **WR/TE** | Targets (58 ✅), receptions (53 ✅), rec yards (42 ✅), rec TDs, fumbles | Need rec TDs, fumbles |
| **K** | FG attempts, FG made, FG by distance (0-39, 40-49, 50+), XP attempts, XP made | Need all kicker stats |
| **DST** | Sacks, INTs, fumble recoveries, TDs, points allowed, yards allowed | Need all defensive stats |

### 2.4 Scoring Breakdown Stats

**Hypothesis:** stat_47-52 might be TD scoring brackets

**Test Method:**
1. Find player with multiple TD types (e.g., RB with rushing TD + receiving TD)
2. Check if stat_47-52 differentiate TD types
3. Validate against ESPN fantasy scoring breakdown

**Files to Deprecate:**
- `docs/espn/espn_player_data.md` → Deprecated, use `docs/espn/endpoints/player_stats.md`
- `docs/espn/espn_team_data.md` → Deprecated, use `docs/espn/endpoints/team_stats.md`
- `docs/espn/espn_api_endpoints.md` → Deprecated, use `docs/espn/README.md`

**Deprecation Notice Template:**
```markdown
# ⚠️ DEPRECATED DOCUMENTATION ⚠️

**Deprecation Date:** 2025-12-22
**Replacement:** See `docs/espn/README.md` for current documentation

**Reason for Deprecation:**
This documentation was found to be incomplete and contained inaccuracies. Comprehensive
testing revealed additional stat IDs and endpoint behaviors not documented here.

**What Changed:**
1. Stat IDs 58 (targets) and 23 (carries) were incorrectly documented as unavailable
2. Complete stat ID mapping now available in `docs/espn/reference/stat_ids.md`
3. Validated response structures with real examples
4. Confirmed absence of odds/betting data in scoreboard endpoint

**Migration Guide:**
See `docs/espn/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for updating code to use new documentation.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Stat IDs Change Without Notice

**Risk:** ESPN may change stat ID mappings in future seasons

**Likelihood:** Low (stat IDs appear stable across seasons)

**Mitigation:**
- Document when stat IDs were validated (include date)
- Include validation scripts in test suite
- Run validation at start of each season
- Monitor for breaking changes

### Risk 2: Incomplete Stat ID Identification

**Risk:** Some stat IDs may not be identifiable through cross-referencing

**Likelihood:** Medium (some obscure stats may not appear on NFL.com)

**Mitigation:**
- Document unknown stat IDs clearly
- Mark confidence level (confirmed, probable, unknown)
- Continue research in future seasons as new data emerges
- Accept that 100% coverage may not be achievable

### Risk 3: ESPN API Changes

**Risk:** ESPN may change API structure or endpoints

**Likelihood:** Low (ESPN API has been stable for years)

**Mitigation:**
- Include API version/date in documentation
- Monitor for breaking changes
- Update documentation when changes occur
- Keep old responses for comparison

---

## 11. Success Metrics
