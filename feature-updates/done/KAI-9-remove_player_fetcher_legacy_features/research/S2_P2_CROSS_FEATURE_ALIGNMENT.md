## S2.P2: Cross-Feature Alignment Check

**Epic:** KAI-9 - remove_player_fetcher_legacy_features
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Status:** N/A (Single-Feature Epic)

---

## Overview

**S2.P2 Purpose:** Pairwise comparison of features to detect naming conflicts, approach conflicts, data structure conflicts, and pattern inconsistencies.

**This Epic:** Single feature (Feature 01 only)

**Result:** Cross-feature alignment check is **NOT APPLICABLE** - requires minimum 2 features for pairwise comparison.

---

## Feature Count

**Total Features:** 1
- Feature 01: Remove Legacy Player Fetcher Features

**Pairwise Comparison Required:** NO (need ≥2 features)

---

## Alignment Status

**Status:** N/A - No cross-feature conflicts possible with single feature

**Conflicts Found:** 0 (N/A)

**Resolutions Applied:** None (N/A)

---

## Validation Loop

**Status:** SKIPPED (N/A for single-feature epic)

**Rationale:** Validation Loop compares features pairwise. With only 1 feature, no pairs exist to validate.

---

## Next Stage

**S2 Complete:** YES
- S2.P1: Complete (Feature 01 - 3 iterations, all gates passed)
- S2.P2: N/A (single feature)

**Proceeding to:** S3 - Cross-Feature Sanity Check

**Note:** S3 will also be simplified for single-feature epic (no cross-feature sanity check needed, will proceed directly to epic testing strategy in S4).

## Audit Trail

**This file documents that S2.P2 was considered and determined to be N/A for this single-feature epic.**

**Evidence:**
- Epic has 1 feature total (documented in EPIC_README.md)
- Feature 01 completed S2.P1 with all gates passed (Gate 1, 2, 3)
- No other features exist for comparison
- Pairwise comparison requires ≥2 features

**S2 Phase Complete:** 2026-02-13
