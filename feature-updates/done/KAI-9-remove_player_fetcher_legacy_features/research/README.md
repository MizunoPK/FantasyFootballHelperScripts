## Research Folder: KAI-9 - remove_player_fetcher_legacy_features

**Created:** 2026-02-13

---

## Purpose

This folder contains epic-level research artifacts that don't fit into feature-specific folders.

**Common uses:**
- Cross-feature analysis documents
- Architectural research
- Performance benchmarking results
- Integration testing notes
- Comparison studies
- Reference documentation

---

## Current Contents

{Currently empty - files will be added as needed during S2-S9}

---

## Organization Guidelines

**File naming convention:**
- Use descriptive names: `{topic}_{type}.md`
- Examples: `integration_analysis.md`, `performance_baseline.md`, `architecture_decisions.md`

**When to add files here:**
- Research applies to multiple features
- Analysis doesn't belong in feature folders
- Cross-cutting concerns need documentation
- Epic-level decisions need tracking

**When NOT to add files here:**
- Feature-specific research (goes in feature folder)
- Implementation notes (goes in feature `implementation_plan.md`)
- Testing notes (goes in feature `test_strategy.md`)
- Debugging artifacts (goes in feature `debugging/` folder)

---

## Notes

This folder is optional - only create research files if needed. Many epics won't require epic-level research beyond what's captured in DISCOVERY.md and feature specs.
