I want to update our system to use 4 different week-specific configs instead of 3
The weeks will be:
1-5
6-9
10-13
14-17

I want the files in data/configs to be updated accordingly
I want the league helper to be updated (if needed) to accomidate the change
I want the simulation to be updated (if needed) to accomidate the change
