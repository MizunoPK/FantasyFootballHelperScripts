The player data fetcher has been broken now that we removed the drafted column from the FantasyPlayer objects
I want to get player data fetcher working again, where it can run end-to-end seemlessly
At minimum I believe this will require:
1. removing references to the drafted column in leu of the drafted_by field
2. disabling the creation of players.csv and players_projected.csv
