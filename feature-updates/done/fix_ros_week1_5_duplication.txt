# Feature Request: Fix ROS/Week1-5 Config Duplication Bug

## Problem Statement

The accuracy simulation's tournament optimization is producing **identical configs** for the `ros` (draft) and `week1-5` horizons, despite:
1. Generating different test values for each horizon
2. Finding different optimal test indices during optimization
3. Code logic treating them as separate horizons
4. All other horizons (week 6-9, 10-13, 14-17) having unique values

**Evidence:**
- draft_config.json and week1-5.json are 100% identical (all 69 parameters match)
- During NORMALIZATION_MAX_SCALE optimization:
  - ros chose test_1 (MAE=68.4213)
  - week1-5 chose test_4 (MAE=3.7939)
- Final configs show both have value 163 (week1-5's optimal, not ros's optimal)

This suggests that **ros horizon is not being optimized independently** - its config is being overwritten by week1-5's config at some point in the process.

## Impact

**High severity:**
- The draft helper (Add to Roster Mode) is using the wrong scoring parameters
- draft_config.json should be optimized for season-long (ROS) projections, not weeks 1-5
- Tournament optimization's core feature (horizon-specific optimization) is broken for ros
- Accuracy simulations are invalid for draft scenarios

## Root Cause Hypothesis

Potential bugs in one of these areas:
1. **Baseline update logic** (`ConfigGenerator.update_baseline_for_horizon`) - may be incorrectly treating ros and week1-5 as the same
2. **Config save logic** (`AccuracyResultsManager._save_optimal_configs`) - may be copying week1-5 to draft_config
3. **Horizon mapping** - "ros" vs "week_1_5" string inconsistency causing misidentification
4. **Config generator** - ros using week1-5's baseline instead of its own

## Acceptance Criteria

After fix:
1. ✅ draft_config.json and week1-5.json have DIFFERENT parameter values
2. ✅ ros horizon chooses optimal values independently from week1-5
3. ✅ All 5 horizons (ros, 1-5, 6-9, 10-13, 14-17) have unique optimal configs
4. ✅ Validation script confirms ros != week1-5 for at least some parameters
5. ✅ Re-running accuracy simulation produces different draft_config vs week1-5

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit test**: Verify `update_baseline_for_horizon('ros', config)` doesn't affect week1-5
2. **Unit test**: Verify horizon string mapping ("ros" vs "week_1_5" vs "draft_config")
3. **Integration test**: Run mini accuracy sim (2 params, 2 test values) and verify ros != week1-5
4. **Validation test**: Run full validation script after fix, confirm diversity

## Success Metrics

- draft_config.json has at least 3 parameters with different values than week1-5.json
- MAE for ros horizon uses ros-specific optimal config, not week1-5's config
- Validation script shows ros and week1-5 as separate horizons with unique values

## Notes

- This bug was discovered during comprehensive parameter validation
- The initial validation document had 3 FALSE ALARMS, but this is a REAL BUG
- All 16 parameters are affected (entire config is duplicated)
- The bug likely exists in the baseline update or config save logic, not parameter generation
