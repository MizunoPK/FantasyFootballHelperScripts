## Purpose

Research Metric 2 (QB Context/Quality Score) to determine:
1. Can we calculate from existing data?
2. Is it available via ESPN API?
3. What free alternatives exist?
4. Historical data availability (CRITICAL)
5. Implementation complexity
6. Recommendation

**Why HIGH Priority:** Affects all WR/TE pass-catchers - a great QB elevates all receivers, poor QB limits upside.
