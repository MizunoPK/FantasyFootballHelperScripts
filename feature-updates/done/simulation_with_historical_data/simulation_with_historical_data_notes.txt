We are going to be updating the simulation to make use of the new historical data that was compiled by the latest compile_historical_data.py script
During the simulation, I want the sim to find all of the '20XX' folders in the sim_data folder. For each config that is tested, it is going to perform a simulation using each year's data. The win rates for configs will now reflect the wins and losses across ALL seasons instead of just one. For each season in the sim_data folder, the simulation will go through the process of simulating a draft and 17 weeks of matches for each config being tested.
For the draft simulations, the data loaded in should be the files from the season being simulated and it should make use of the players.csv and players_projected.csv files contained in the weeks/week_01 folder
When simulating matches and determining starters, the simulation should use the files from the season being simulated and it should make use of the players.csv and players_projected.csv files that correspond to the week being simulated
