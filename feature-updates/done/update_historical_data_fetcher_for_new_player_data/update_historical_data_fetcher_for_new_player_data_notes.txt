The compile_historical_data.py script and historical_data_compiler folder is meant to help with compiling data from previous years to use for the simulations
We need to update those scripts to output the new json formatted player data files along with all the new stats
The historical_data_compiler should no longer produce players.csv or players_projected.csv, instead it will generate the 6 player json files for each week in the historical year
Each of the 6 json files in each week folder will be a snapshot of that point in time, like what players.csv and players_projected.csv has been doing
