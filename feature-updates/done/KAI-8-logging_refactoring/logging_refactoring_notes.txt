Our goal is to improve logging and the saving of logs
We'll have a logs folder at the root of the project, with subfolders for each major script
E.g.
- logs
    - league_helper
    - player-data-fetcher
    - accuracy_sim
    - win_rate_sim
    - historical_data_compiler
    - schedule-data-fetcher

Each folder will have a timestamped .log file named something like league_helper-{timestamp}.log
The log should be capped at 500 lines
When logging to the file, if the file already is at 500 lines, then create a new timestamped log to save to

For each log subfolder, cap the total number of logs that can exist at 50 each. When going above that, automatically delete the oldest log file

Add the logs folder to the gitignore

Additionally, the Debug and Info level logs in each script should be evaluated for quality
Debug level logs should be conveying enough extra information for a user to be able to trace data flow and function execution, but should not *overwhelm* the logs. 
Info level logs should provide enough information that a user at runtime would want to know to inform them the general need-to-know aspects of the script execution. 

Each script should have the ability to toggle saving to log files on and off depending on a CLI argument
