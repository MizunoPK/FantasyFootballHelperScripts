**Epic:** KAI-8-logging_refactoring
**Created:** 2026-02-06 (S1)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-06

## Purpose

This folder centralizes research and analysis documents created during the epic's lifecycle, keeping the epic root folder clean and organized.

**What goes here:**
- Research documents created during S1 Discovery Phase
- Analysis documents created during S2 Feature Deep Dives
- Investigation notes that don't fit in feature folders
- Cross-feature research findings
- Architectural analysis documents

**What does NOT go here:**
- Feature-specific files (go in `feature_XX_{name}/` folders)
- Epic-level tracking files (stay in epic root: EPIC_README.md, DISCOVERY.md, etc.)
- Implementation files (go in feature folders)
- Test files (go in feature folders or appropriate test locations)

---

## Current Contents

**Discovery Phase (S1.P3):**
- {Files created during Discovery Phase will be listed here}
- Note: DISCOVERY.md stays in epic root (not in research/)

**S2 Research:**
- {Research documents from S2 deep dives will be listed here}

**Other Research:**
- {Any additional research documents}

---

## Organization Tips

- Name files descriptively (e.g., `handler_options_analysis.md`, `cli_integration_patterns.md`)
- Use subfolders if research grows large
- Reference research documents from feature specs using relative paths
- Keep research separate from implementation artifacts

---

## Notes

Research files support decision-making but are not part of final deliverables. They provide historical context for why decisions were made during planning phases.
