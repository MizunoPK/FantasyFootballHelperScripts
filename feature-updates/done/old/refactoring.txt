Look through every directory and file systematically and perform the following:
- Add comprehensive unit tests for every function. Try to also include edge case testing wherever possible
- Add comprehensive code comments, function descriptions, and class descriptions. Do NOT include a date in any comments, and make sure to mark Kai Mizuno as the author
- Find ways to reorganize files into more readable and understandable structures. For example, categorizing variables and having them grouped together when being defined, or having certain functions with similar functionality all next to one another.
- Find ways to make files more modular. You can break up files into several smaller files. Make use of util folders to keep the directory structure clean.
- Ensure there is not duplicate code. If there are ways to turn something into a shared module, do it.
- Make sure the README and CLAUDE documentation are up to date based on the findings about functionality and implementation across the repo
- Ensure there is no un-used variables or functions or classes. Delete anything un-used
- Improve logging. Try to keep the 'DEBUG' flag for the spam and minor logs that will get run a lot, and 'INFO' for anything particularly important to call out
- Identify places that there could be improved code quality
