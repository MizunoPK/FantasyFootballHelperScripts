Add a new mode to the League Helper called "Reserve Assessment" that identifies high-value reserve/waiver players worth monitoring.

## Goal
Identify undrafted players (drafted=0) who have injury risk but significant upside based on historical performance. These are "reserve stash" candidates - players worth picking up speculatively before they become healthy.

## Core Requirements

1. **Player Identification**
   - Filter players.csv for drafted=0 AND injury_status = HIGH risk
   - Exclude players with 0 projected points for current season
   - Include only skill positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, exclude K/DST)

2. **Historical Performance Scoring**
   - Load player data from data/last_season/ folder
   - Match current season players to last season by name + position + team
   - Calculate "potential value" score using:
        1. Normalization (based on total points scored last season)
        2. Player Rating Multiplier (based on last season data)
        3. Team Quality Multiplier (based on this season data)
        4. Performance Multiplier (based on last season data)
        5. Strength of Schedule Multiplier (based on this season data)


3. **Recommendation Display**
   - Show top 10-15 reserve candidates ranked by potential value
   - For each player display the ScoredPlayer object like the other trade modes

4. **Integration Points**
   - Add as option #5 in main League Helper menu
   - Create new ReserveAssessmentModeManager class following existing mode patterns
   - Use existing PlayerManager, ConfigManager, TeamDataManager infrastructure
   - Reuse scoring helper functions where applicable

5. **Data Requirements**
   - Ensure data/last_season/players.csv exists with same schema as current players.csv. Same goes for the teams.csv file
   - Handle missing historical data gracefully (skip players with no last season data)
