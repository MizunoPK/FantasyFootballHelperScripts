Here are a list of changes I want made to the various trade modes...
For the Manual Trade Visualizer, I want to update the flow such that:
Step 1: Select the team to trade with
Step 2: Show my entire roster, then their entire roster. My roster will be numbered 1-15, and theirs numbered 16-30. Have the display be organized by position in the order of QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DST, then ordered by score
Step 3: The user types out the numbers of all players they would like to have in the trade. So typing something like '2,6,18,21' would trade players 2 and 6 from my team and players 18 and 21 from their team
Step 4: The trade is processed and the results displayed as normal
If the trade is not possible due to position constraints, then alert the user and go back to Step 2.

For the Trade Suggestor and Waiver Optimizer, have the resulting file output be named "trade_info_{timestamp}.txt" or "waiver_info_{timestamp}.txt" respectively
