I want to add three new combination options for the Trade Suggestor specifically - two-for-one, three-for-one, and three for two.
For these options, include options that'd take 2 players from my team for 1 player from the other team and vis versa, for 3 players from my team for 1 player from the other team and vis versa, and for 3 players from my team for 2 players from their team and vis versa
Do the usual trade assessment, except, fill any spots that are lost in the trade by using the same methods as the Add to Roster mode to get the top recommendation to fill the spot

## PHASE 1: WAIVER SYSTEM (COMPLETED)

### Requirements:
1. Add waiver recommendations for opponent team (not just user)
2. Team scores must include waiver pickups in calculation
3. Team receiving LESS players uses waiver system to fill empty roster spots
4. Both user and opponent waivers displayed in output (console and file)

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE
- TradeSnapshot updated with their_waiver_recommendations
- All 6 trade types (2:1, 1:2, 3:1, 1:3, 3:2, 2:3) calculate opponent waivers
- Waivers added to rosters BEFORE TradeSimTeam creation
- Team scores naturally include waiver players
- Console and file output show both user and opponent waivers
- Tests updated and passing (362/362 tests pass)

## PHASE 2: DROP SYSTEM (COMPLETED)

### Requirements:
1. When unequal trades violate MAX_PLAYERS roster limit, try drop variations
2. Team receiving MORE players uses drop system (must drop extra players)
3. Team receiving LESS players uses waiver system (from Phase 1)
4. Only consider dropping lowest-scored players of each position (top 2 per position)
5. Drops must include the player(s) already being traded away
6. Only suggest if final team score > original team score
7. Display which player(s) are being dropped in output
8. Works for all 6 unequal trade types:
   - 1:2 (user needs to drop 1 extra) ✅ COMPLETE
   - 1:3 (user needs to drop 2 extra) ✅ COMPLETE
   - 2:3 (user needs to drop 1 extra) ✅ COMPLETE
   - 2:1 (opponent needs to drop 1 extra) ✅ COMPLETE
   - 3:1 (opponent needs to drop 2 extra) ✅ COMPLETE
   - 3:2 (opponent needs to drop 1 extra) ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ TradeSnapshot updated with my_dropped_players and their_dropped_players fields (lines 17-18, 40-41)
- ✅ Helper method _get_lowest_scored_players_per_position() created (lines 946-997)
- ✅ 1:2 trades: User drop system implemented (lines 1487-1553)
- ✅ 1:3 trades: User drop system with 2-player combinations (lines 1705-1771)
- ✅ 2:3 trades: User drop system implemented (lines 1927-1993)
- ✅ 2:1 trades: Opponent drop system implemented (lines 1427-1478)
- ✅ 3:1 trades: Opponent drop system with 2-player combinations (lines 1695-1746)
- ✅ 3:2 trades: Opponent drop system implemented (lines 1965-2016)
- ✅ Console display output for dropped players (lines 384-394)
- ✅ File output for dropped players (lines 2274-2284)
- ✅ Test updates for drop functionality (6 new tests added)
- ✅ Validation: All 367 tests passing (100%)

### How Drop System Works:

**Trigger Condition**: When a trade would violate MAX_PLAYERS (15 player limit)

**Drop Selection Process**:
1. Identify team receiving more players (net positive roster change)
2. Call `_get_lowest_scored_players_per_position()` to get drop candidates
3. Exclude players already being traded and locked players
4. Get lowest 2 scorers from each position (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DST)
5. Try all combinations of drops needed (1 player or 2 players depending on net change)

**Validation & Scoring**:
- Validate roster with drops applied
- Create TradeSimTeam with drops included
- Compare final score against ORIGINAL team score (not hypothetical legal trade)
- Only suggest if improvement ≥ MIN_TRADE_IMPROVEMENT (30 points)

**Example Scenarios**:

**1:2 Trade (User drops 1)**:
```
Starting: 15 players (full roster)
Trade: Give Player A → Get Players X, Y
Without drop: 15 - 1 + 2 = 16 (VIOLATION)
With drop: 15 - 1 + 2 - 1 = 15 (VALID)
System tries: Drop each of lowest 2 scorers per position
Suggests: Best scoring outcome where final team > original team
```

**3:1 Trade (Opponent drops 2)**:
```
Opponent: 15 players (full roster)
Trade: Give Player A → Get Players X, Y, Z
Without drop: 15 - 1 + 3 = 17 (VIOLATION)
With drop: 15 - 1 + 3 - 2 = 15 (VALID)
System tries: All combinations of 2 drops from lowest scorers
Suggests: If both teams improve vs their original scores
```

### Output Format:

**Console Display**:
```
#1 - Trade with Opponent Team
  My improvement: +45.50 pts
  Their improvement: +32.75 pts
  I give:
    - [RB] [MIA] Player A - 85.50 pts
  I receive:
    - [WR] [BUF] Player X - 95.25 pts
    - [WR] [KC] Player Y - 88.75 pts
  Players I Must Drop (to make room):
    - [TE] [NYJ] Player B - 45.00 pts (lowest scorer)
```

**File Output**: Same format saved to `trade_info_{timestamp}.txt`
