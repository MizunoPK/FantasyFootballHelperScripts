Carefully analze the reports in docs/espn
I want a comprehensive analysis on if there are methods we could pursue to improve the accuracy of all the team ranking values contained in teams.csv
I am currently not confident that the ranking scores for the columns like offensive ranking and positional defense ranking are properly representing the real team rankings. I want a report to be made on the data that we could pull on the teams from the espn api and how we can use that to calculate team rankings
Place this report in a new folder at docs/team_rankings
