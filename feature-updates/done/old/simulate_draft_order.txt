We are going to add DRAFT_ORDER as a configurable parameter in the iterative simulation.
The config range will be defined as (1,30)
The numbers selected from the range will correspond to files in simulation/sim_data/draft_order_possibilities
When creating the configs that are being tested, DRAFT_ORDER will be set to whatever it is set to in the file number that was chosen
