The goal of this update is to create thourough reports on the ESPN API used by the player-data-fetcher and place the reports in the docs folder.
I want a detailed analysis on:
- The various endpoints available to us
- All the pieces of player data available to us 
- All the pieces of NFL team data available to us

This analysis should not be specific to the player-data-fetcher's context. These reports should be about the ESPN API in general and be able to be used as a reference either for the player-data-fetcher or any other future scripts.
