We are going to be making an update to the iterative simulation based on some new variables that have been scaffolded, the NUM_PARAMETERS_TO_TEST and generate_iterative_combinations function in ConfigGenerator
Get all configs for the base config like normal
Get NUM_PARAMETERS_TO_TEST - 1 random other parameters and generate configs for them as if they were the sole one being tested
Merge all the config lists together, and add on configs that contain combinations of the values fetched for each parameter
For example if config lists were generated such that the first one is testing values for parameter 1 equaling [1,2] and the second set of configs are testing values for parameter 2 equaling [3,4], then a final set of configs would be generated where the values being tested look like: [[1], [2], [3], [4], [1,3], [2,4]]
Changes for this should only be made in the generate_iterative_combinations function.
