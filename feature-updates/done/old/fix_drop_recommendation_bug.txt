Fix Drop Recommendation Bug in Trade Suggestor
==================================================

ISSUE:
------
When a trade would put a team over a position limit, the drop recommendation system
suggests dropping the globally lowest-scoring player instead of the lowest-scoring
player from the over-limit position.

EXAMPLE:
User receives QB in trade (already has 2 QBs, max is 2)
- Post-trade: 3 QBs (over limit!)
- Should suggest: Drop lowest-scoring QB
- Actually suggests: Drop lowest-scoring DST (globally worst player)

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
File: league_helper/trade_simulator_mode/trade_analyzer.py
Function: _get_lowest_scored_players_per_position (lines 275-327)

The function returns the lowest-scoring players from ALL positions, without checking
which positions are actually over the limit. It's called when roster validation fails,
but doesn't know WHY it failed (over MAX_PLAYERS vs. over position limit).

SOLUTION:
---------
Create a new position-aware drop recommendation function that:
1. Takes the post-trade roster
2. Calculates position counts
3. Identifies which positions exceed MAX_POSITIONS limits
4. Returns drop candidates ONLY from over-limit positions
5. Falls back to lowest-scoring from all positions if MAX_PLAYERS exceeded but no position over-limit

NEW FUNCTION SIGNATURE:
-----------------------
def _get_position_aware_drop_candidates(
    self,
    team: TradeSimTeam,
    post_trade_roster: List[FantasyPlayer],
    exclude_players: List[FantasyPlayer],
    num_per_position: int = 2
) -> List[FantasyPlayer]:
    """
    Get drop candidates from positions that exceed MAX_POSITIONS limits.

    Args:
        team: Original team for scoring context
        post_trade_roster: Roster after trade (to check position counts)
        exclude_players: Players to exclude (being traded away)
        num_per_position: How many drops to suggest per over-limit position

    Returns:
        List of drop candidates from over-limit positions only
    """

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
--------------------
1. Calculate position counts for post_trade_roster
2. Identify positions where count > MAX_POSITIONS[position]
3. If any positions over-limit:
   - Return lowest-scoring players from those positions only
4. Else (just over MAX_PLAYERS):
   - Return lowest-scoring players from all positions (current behavior)

CHANGES REQUIRED:
-----------------
1. Add new function: _get_position_aware_drop_candidates()
2. Update calls in process_manual_trade (lines 422, 431)
3. Update calls in unequal trade sections (around line 756)
4. Keep original _get_lowest_scored_players_per_position for backward compatibility

TEST CASES:
-----------
1. Test QB over-limit → only suggests QB drops
2. Test multiple positions over-limit → suggests from all over-limit positions
3. Test MAX_PLAYERS exceeded but no position over-limit → suggests from all positions
4. Test with locked players (should not be suggested)
5. Test with excluded players (should not be suggested)
