The new player rating calculations during the player-data-fetcher's runs are not behaving like I want them to. They involve converting a rank to a rating that is split into tiers, when I'd rather just have normalized positional ranks.
Here is the flow I would like to see occur in the espn client regarding the positional ranks:
1. The current week's ranking is taken from the rankings object (unchanged from current implementation)
2. Compile a map of all positions and their associated lowest and highest rank
3. After processing all players, normalize each of their ranks to be between 1 and 100 based on the lowest and highest ranks noted in the last step. A 1 should still be for the worst player, and a 100 should still be for the best player.
4. Make sure that the player's player_rating data is set to the normalized positional rating calculated like above

The simulation needs to be updated with the new calculation method as well. The agent should
1. Read through players_projected_backup.csv and players_actual_backup.csv in the simulation/sim_data folder
2. Determine the lowest and highest rank for each position
3. Create new versions of players_projected.csv and players_actual.csv by copying the backup versions then update the player_rating column for each player to be normalized based on their min and max positional player ranking found in the last step

Note: The player_rating column is being turned into the equivalent of a positional_ranking
  column. We are going to take the player ranking value from the espn data, convert it to a normalized positional ranking, then save that
  value to the player_rating column. For the simulation, we'd be taking the initial values from the _backup player_rating column instead
  of from the espn data
