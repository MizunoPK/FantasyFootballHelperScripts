Carefully analze the reports in docs/espn
I want a comprehensive analysis on if there are methods we could pursue to improve the accuracy of all the individual
I want a report to be made on the data that we could pull on the players from the espn api and how we can use that to determine player ratings
Compare methodologies you find to the existing player rating system and determine if it is a worthwhile improvement to make
Consider things like: How current is the player ratings currently put in the players.csv file? Would it be more worthwhile to consider player ratings based on position (e.g. there would be a #1 rated QB, #1 rated RB, etc.)?
Place this report in a new folder at docs/team_rankings
