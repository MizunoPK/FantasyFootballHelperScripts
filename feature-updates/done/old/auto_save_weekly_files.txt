As part of the player data fetcher, save the players and teams files to the season historical data automatically if they have not been saved yet for that week.
After the player data fetcher finishes updating players.csv, players_projected.csv, and teams.csv files in the data folder, it should check to see if it should copy the files into the data/historical_data folder. It should see if there is a folder yet at data/historical_data/{Season}/{Current Week}. If not, then it should create the folder and copy the 3 files into the new folder. If it does exist, then do nothing.
