We are going to be adding another bye week penalty alongside the existing BASE_BYE_PENALTY parameter in the league_config.
This new parameter will be called DIFFERENT_PLAYER_BYE_OVERLAP_PENALTY
This parameter will be applied during the bye week penalty calculation of the PlayerManager scoring system
The BASE_BYE_PENALTY will be applied based on the number of players whose bye week overlaps with the player being scored and who have the SAME position
The DIFFERENT_PLAYER_BYE_OVERLAP_PENALTY will be applied based on the number of players on the team's roster whose bye week overlaps with the player being scored and who have a DIFFERENT position
Inplement this in the exact same way as BASE_BYE_PENALTY
Update the Simulation to allow for testing of different parameters for this new penalty
