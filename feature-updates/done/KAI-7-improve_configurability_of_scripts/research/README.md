# Research Folder

**Purpose:** Centralized location for all epic-level research and analysis documents

**Created:** 2026-01-28

---

## Overview

This folder contains research documents that span multiple features or provide epic-level analysis. Feature-specific research should be kept in individual feature folders.

---

## Documents

**Epic-Level Research:**
- {Will be created as needed during S2-S4}

**Cross-Feature Analysis:**
- {Will be created during S3 if needed for conflict resolution}

**Integration Research:**
- {Will be created during S4 for epic testing strategy}

---

## Guidelines

**When to create research docs here:**
- Epic-level codebase reconnaissance (affects multiple features)
- Cross-feature integration analysis
- Architecture decisions spanning multiple features
- Shared patterns or utilities research

**When to create research docs in feature folders:**
- Feature-specific implementation research
- Single-feature code analysis
- Feature-specific algorithm design

---

**Note:** This folder keeps the epic root clean and organized. All research documents should use descriptive names and include creation dates.
