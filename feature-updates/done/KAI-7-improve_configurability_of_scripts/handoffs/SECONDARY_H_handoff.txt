I'm joining as a secondary agent for epic KAI-7-improve_configurability_of_scripts.

**Configuration:**
Epic Path: C:/Users/kmgam/code/FantasyFootballHelperScripts/feature-updates/KAI-7-improve_configurability_of_scripts
My Assignment: feature_09_documentation
Primary Agent ID: Primary-Agent-2026-01-28
My Agent ID: Secondary-H
Starting Stage: S2.P1 (Feature Deep Dive - Research Phase)

**Coordination:**
- Inbox: agent_comms/primary_to_secondary_h.md (check before every action)
- Outbox: agent_comms/secondary_h_to_primary.md (send updates)
- Checkpoint: agent_checkpoints/secondary_h.json (update every 15 min)
- STATUS: feature_09_documentation/STATUS (update at phase transitions)

**Sync Points:**
- After S2.P3 complete: Signal completion, WAIT for Primary to run S3
- After Primary completes S4: Proceed to S5 (implementation sequential)

Begin S2.P1 now.
