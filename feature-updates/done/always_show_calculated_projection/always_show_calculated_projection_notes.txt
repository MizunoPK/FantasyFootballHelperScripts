Update scoring methods to always return the un-normalized projected point value like what is shown in the Starter Helper
Update the to_strings and player print statements to always show what the calculated projected points for the player is

The scoring method should be taking the final 
score of the player, then undo'ing the Normalization that was done, thus creating a 'calculated 
projected point' value that is different from the original projected point values from players.csv
