We missed adding a bye_week field to the player data in the new player json files
We need to update the player-data-fetcher and the compile_historical_data scripts to determine what bye week the player will have, then set that as a field in the json
e.g.
{
      "id": "3918298",
      "name": "Josh Allen",
      "team": "BUF",
      "position": "QB",
      ...,
      "bye_week": 6,
      ...
}
