# Research and Analysis Documents

This folder contains all research, analysis, and verification reports for the epic.

**Purpose:**
- Keeps epic root folder clean (only EPIC_README, test plan, lessons learned)
- Centralizes reference material shared across features (or used by single feature)
- Clear separation: feature specs = implementation guidance, research = context

**File Naming:**
- `{TOPIC}_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed analysis of specific topic
- `VERIFICATION_REPORT_{DATE}.md` - Verification findings
- `RESEARCH_FINDINGS_{DATE}.md` - General research results
- `{FEATURE_NAME}_DISCOVERY.md` - Discoveries from feature deep dive

**Expected Research Documents:**
- `k_dst_research_findings.txt` - Results from 7 research tasks in epic request
- Additional analysis documents as needed during Stage 2

**All research documents go here from the start.**
