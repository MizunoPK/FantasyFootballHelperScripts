# Documentation Feature - Lessons Learned

> **PURPOSE**: This file captures issues encountered during development and QA that could have been prevented by better planning or development processes. After the feature is complete, these lessons will be used to update both guides in the `feature-updates/guides/` folder.

## How to Use This File

**When to add entries:**
1. During development: When you discover an edge case the planning phase should have identified
2. During development: When you find an issue that better verification would have caught
3. During QA: When testing reveals a problem the development process should have prevented
4. After user feedback: When the user reports something that wasn't working as expected

**What to capture:**
- What went wrong or was missed
- Why it happened (root cause)
- How the guides could be updated to prevent this in the future
- Specific additions or changes to recommend
