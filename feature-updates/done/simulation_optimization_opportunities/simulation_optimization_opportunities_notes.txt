I'd like to take a careful analysis of the iterative simulation and find any opprotunities to increase the space and time efficiency of the program
Take whatever chances we can to effectively use parallel threads, but also work under the assumption that we may sometimes run the simulation on a system where we are forced to use only a single thread.
We are okay with increasing the code complexity and some maintainability if it means the overall efficiency has increased
