# Feature 01: Stage 5d Cross-Feature Alignment - Summary

**Purpose:** Review all remaining (not-yet-implemented) feature specs to ensure alignment with ACTUAL implementation

**Date:** 2025-12-31 19:35
**Status:** ✅ NOT APPLICABLE (epic has only 1 feature)

---

## Stage 5d Status: NOT APPLICABLE

**Epic Structure:**
- Total features in epic: 1
- Features completed (Stage 5c done): 1
- Features remaining (not yet Stage 5c): 0

**Conclusion:**
This epic contains only a single feature (feature_01_fix_player_round_assignment). There are **NO remaining features** that need to be reviewed for alignment with feature_01's implementation.

According to STAGE_5d_post_feature_alignment_guide.md (lines 212-216):
```
If NO remaining features:
   - Skip Stage 5d entirely
   - Proceed to Stage 5e (Testing Plan Update)
   - Then Stage 6 (Epic Final QC)
```

**Stage 5d is therefore SKIPPED for this epic.**

---

## Rationale

**Why Stage 5d exists:**
Stage 5d ensures that remaining (not-yet-implemented) features have their specs updated based on insights from the ACTUAL implementation of just-completed features. This prevents spec drift and catches cascading changes early.

**Why it's not applicable here:**
- This is a single-feature epic (bug fix)
- Feature 01 is the ONLY feature
- No other features exist whose specs need updating
- Therefore, cross-feature alignment review is not needed

---

## Stage 5d Completion Verification

**All Stage 5d Criteria (for epics with multiple features):**
- N/A - Epic has only 1 feature
- No remaining features to review
- No specs to update
- No features needing rework
- No cross-feature dependencies to align

**For single-feature epics:**
- ✅ Verified epic contains only 1 feature
- ✅ Confirmed no remaining features exist
- ✅ Stage 5d correctly identified as not applicable
- ✅ Ready to proceed to Stage 5e (Testing Plan Update)

---

## Next Stage: Stage 5e (Testing Plan Update)

**Purpose:** Update epic_smoke_test_plan.md based on ACTUAL implementation of feature_01

**Why Stage 5e IS applicable (even for single-feature epics):**
- Epic-level smoke test plan needs updating based on actual implementation
- Test scenarios may need adjustment based on what was ACTUALLY built
- Integration points may have changed during implementation
- Stage 5e keeps testing plan current before Stage 6 (Epic Final QC)

**Next Action:** Read STAGE_5e_post_feature_testing_update_guide.md and begin Stage 5e

## README Agent Status Update

Updated EPIC_README.md Agent Status to reflect:
- Stage 5d: SKIPPED (not applicable - single feature epic)
- Next stage: Stage 5e (Testing Plan Update)
- Current guide: STAGE_5e_post_feature_testing_update_guide.md (TO READ)
