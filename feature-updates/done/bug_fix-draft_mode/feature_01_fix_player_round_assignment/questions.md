# Feature 01: Fix Player-to-Round Assignment - Questions for User

**Created:** 2025-12-31 (After Stage 5a Round 1-3 complete)
**Status:** ✅ NO QUESTIONS NEEDED

---

## Summary

**Confidence Level After 24 Iterations:** HIGH

**Questions Status:** ✅ None needed

**Reasoning:**
After completing all 24 verification iterations across 3 rounds in Stage 5a:
- Round 1 (Iterations 1-7 + 4a): Confidence = HIGH
- Round 2 (Iterations 8-16): Confidence maintained = HIGH
- Round 3 (Iterations 17-24 + 23a): Confidence maintained = HIGH

All requirements are clear, all interfaces verified, all algorithms traced, all integration points verified. No uncertainties blocking implementation.

## Iteration Checkpoints

### Round 1 Checkpoint (After Iteration 7)
**Confidence Evaluation:**
- Requirements Understanding: HIGH
- Algorithms Clarity: HIGH
- Interfaces Verified: HIGH
- Integration Points: HIGH
- Test Strategy: HIGH
- **Overall:** HIGH

**Decision:** Proceed to Round 2 (no questions needed)

### Round 2 Checkpoint (After Iteration 16)
**Confidence Evaluation:**
- Test Strategy: HIGH (>90% coverage achieved)
- Algorithm Traceability: HIGH (re-verified)
- Data Flow: HIGH (re-verified)
- Integration Gaps: NONE
- **Overall:** HIGH

**Decision:** Proceed to Round 3 (no questions needed)

### Round 3 Final Checkpoint (After Iteration 24)
**Implementation Readiness:**
- All 24 iterations: ✅ COMPLETE
- Iteration 4a (MANDATORY GATE): ✅ PASSED
- Iteration 23a (MANDATORY GATE - all 4 parts): ✅ PASSED
- Confidence level: HIGH
- Blocking uncertainties: NONE

**Decision:** Ready for implementation (GO) - no questions needed

## User Decisions Already Made (from Stage 2)

All decisions were resolved during Stage 2 (Feature Deep Dive) via checklist.md:

| Question | User Decision | Date | Impact |
|----------|--------------|------|--------|
| Implementation Approach | Option B (Helper Method) | 2025-12-31 | Task 1: Create helper method |
| Test Coverage Level | Option C (Comprehensive) | 2025-12-31 | 7 comprehensive tests required |
| Integration Test with User Data | Yes | 2025-12-31 | Task 9: Integration test |
| FLEX Configuration | Standard (RB, WR) | 2025-12-31 | Helper method uses ["RB", "WR"] |
| Documentation Level | Option A (Minimal - docstring only) | 2025-12-31 | No inline comments |

**All implementation decisions finalized ✅**

## No Additional Questions

**After 24 verification iterations, no additional questions arose.**

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ Spec.md is comprehensive and unambiguous
2. ✅ All interfaces verified by reading actual source code
3. ✅ All algorithms clearly defined in spec
4. ✅ All integration points verified (no orphan code)
5. ✅ All dependencies verified
6. ✅ Test strategy comprehensive (>90% coverage)
7. ✅ All edge cases covered
8. ✅ All risks assessed (all LOW or NONE)

## Ready for Implementation

**Stage 5a Result:** ✅ COMPLETE - 100% confidence

**Next:** Stage 5b (Implementation Execution)
