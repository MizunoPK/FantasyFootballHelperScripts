After a new optimal_* folder is created by the iterative simulation, I want to update the configs files in the root data folder with the new info.
We don't want to just replace the files in the data folder. We need to follow the following requirements:
- CURRENT_NFL_WEEK, NFL_SEASON, MAX_POSITIONS, FLEX_ELIGIBLE_POSITIONS, and INJURY_PENALTIES must remain the same as whatever they are set to in the original league_config.json file that is being updated.
- SCHEDULE_SCORING'S MIN_WEEKS, IMPACT_SCALE, and WEIGHT should be set to the same values as what is set in the MATCHUP_SCORING section in the new corresponding optimal json file
- All other parameter values should be set to whatever they are in the new corresponding optimal file 

This work may be partially implemented already but is not working as expected.
