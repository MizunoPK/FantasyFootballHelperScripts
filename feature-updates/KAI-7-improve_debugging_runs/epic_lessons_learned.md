## Purpose

Document lessons learned throughout this epic for future reference and guide improvements.

---

## S1 - Epic Planning Lessons

### What Went Well
- Discovery Phase identified that 2 of 5 League Helper modes were already non-interactive
- User questions clarified scope early (debug = all features, real APIs, timestamped logs)
- Performance constraint (5 min) added before implementation began

### What Could Be Improved
- Initial request said "4 modes" but there are actually 5 - always verify counts

### Discoveries
- Existing simulation scripts already have reduced-run modes (`single`, `--test-values`)
- LoggingManager already supports file logging with rotation
