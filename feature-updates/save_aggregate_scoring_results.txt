I want to add a menu item in the league helper that allows the user to save a file about how all players are scored for the current week or for the entire season
This new file will be a json that looks like this:
{
    player_id: <calculated projected points>
}
The file should be saved to data/historical_data/{SEASON}/{WEEK}/calculated_projected_points.json
The new mode should be in the top level of the menus at the bottom and be labeled 'Save Calculated Projected Points'
The scoring should use the same scoring call and parameters as the starter helper. We are aiming to save what the starter helper would output for all players for their calculated projected points if they were on a lineup
If the current week is set to 0, then the scoring method should use the entire season's compiled projected points instead of the specific week points and the file should be saved to data/historical_data/{SEASON}/calculated_season_long_projected_points.json

We are also going to update player-data-fetcher to no longer save files to the historical_data folder. Instead, we are going to update the league helper as part of this new mode to also copy the current versions of all the relevant files into the historical_data the same way that player-data-fetcher did
