I want to make it easier to do test runs of each script
There should be a way to automate a test that for example runs a single simulation and creates log files
Make it easier to quickly smoke test and allow an agent to test by themselves
I want to be able to have a debugging version run of:
- Every mode in the League helper
- Player data fetcher
- Win Rate Sim
- Accuracy Sim
- Historical Data fetcher
- Schedule Data Fetcher
