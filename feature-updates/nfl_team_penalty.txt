Have a penalty during Add to Roster mode for specific NFL teams

We'll put the following configs in league_config.json

NFL_TEAM_PENALTY = ["LV", "NYJ", "NYG", "KC"]
NFL_TEAM_PENALTY_WEIGHT = 0.75

The above settings would mean that for any player on the Raiders, Jets, Giants, or Chiefs... their final score would be multiplied by 0.75

This is a user-specific setting that will not be simulated in the simulations. The settings will only be used to reflect the user's team preferences and perferred strategy. 

Simulation configs should look like this:
NFL_TEAM_PENALTY = []
NFL_TEAM_PENALTY_WEIGHT = 1.0
