I want to start giving a static bonus to players during the starter helper scoring if the game they play is on a Sunday
SUNDAY_BONUS=5
This will involve looking at season_schedule.csv, finding the game that the player will play, and determining what day of the week the game will be played on.
When the schedule is loaded in, the code can go ahead and determine the day of the week each team will play on for CURRENT_NFL_WEEK and cache it like:
day_of_week_cache = {
    "KC": THURSDAY,
    "DEN": SUNDAY
}
