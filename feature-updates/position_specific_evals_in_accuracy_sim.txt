I want to add another config to the Accuracy Sim that sets which positions to include in the accuracy evaluations per parameter
It would look something like this:
PARAMETER_POSITION_MAPPING = {
    "TEAM_QUALITY": [QB, RB, WR, TE, K]
    "PERFORMANCE": [QB, RB, WR, TE, DST]
    "WIND": [QB, WR, K]
    etc
}
Only positions included in the parameter's array should have their players pulled in to rank and evaluate accuracy for the varied configs of the given parameter
