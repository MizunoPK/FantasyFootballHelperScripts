Add an option to the Trade Visualizer that allows you to visualize a specific trade between one or more of the user's players and one or more of the waiver players 
This option should appear in the list of other teams that the user can choose to trade from
Any trades that are simulated should not bother considering any position limits or team constraints on the waivers "team". It should only assess how the user's team will change
