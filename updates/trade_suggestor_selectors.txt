We are going to be adding more selections to the Trade Suggestor flow to make it easier to customize the output.
When the user first enters the Trade suggestor section, it should present the user with a list of the teams they can trade with like what happens in the Trade Visualizer. The user will select just one team to find trades for.
The system should then present another list selection for what types of trades to look for. This will be 1:1,1:2,2:1,2:2,3:2,2:3,3:3. They should be numbered 1-7 and the user should be able to select multiple in a comma seperated list like when the user is selecting multiple players in the Trade Visualizer
The system will then look for trades with the specific team and only looking for the selected combinations
