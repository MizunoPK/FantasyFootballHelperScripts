I want to make a special version of run_simulation.py that helps us compile a json file that indicates how effective each draft mode possibility is.
The new script would run a simulation for every file in the draft mode possibilities, and add the results of the run to the new json file.
The new file should associate files with their win percentage
E.g.:
{
    "1": 70.2
    "2": 80.1
}
