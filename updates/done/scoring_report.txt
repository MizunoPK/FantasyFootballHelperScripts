I want to create a thourough and detailed set of reports in a new docs/scoring that go over the current state of the scoring algorithm. 
The scoring value uses several different metrics to create a total score for a player. For every metric, I want you to do the following:
1. Create a report in the new docs/scoring specific to the metric being assessed
2. Determine what modes in the League Helper are currently making use of the metric, and any other places in the code that make use of the metric
3. Analyze how the League Helper gets the value or multiplier for the metric
4. Analyze what calculations are involved in the League Helper when applying the metric
5. Where the data used in the calculations comes from - i.e. what values derived from other values vs what is taken from players.csv and where within players.csv it comes from.
6. How the data in the files used in the metric is populated. This will primarily relate to players.csv, players_projected.csv, and teams.csv. I want to know exactly how the player data fetcher gets and saves the data used in the metric.
7. I want a detailed analysis of the json objects we recieve from the ESPN API and where the data used by the metric comes from within those objects 
8. I want to see examples of how the metric gets applied to the top 20 players in each position and a walk through of how the metric's value/multiplier gets calculated
