OBJECTIVE: Overhaul players_projected.csv Creation in Player Data Fetcher

BACKGROUND:
Research has been completed on the ESPN API and current implementation. See:
- docs/research/players_projected_implementation_analysis.md
- docs/research/espn_api_historical_projections_research.md

KEY FINDINGS FROM RESEARCH:
1. ESPN API provides projections via statSourceId=1 + appliedTotal field
2. ESPN API provides actual scores via statSourceId=0 + appliedTotal field
3. The projectedTotal field mentioned in code comments does NOT exist
4. ESPN retains historical projection data even after games are played
5. Current code prioritizes statSourceId=0 (actuals) - this is CORRECT for players.csv
6. Current players_projected.csv has mixed data (some actuals, some projections) - this is the bug

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- We need to extract BOTH values from ESPN and be smart about which goes where
- players.csv week columns should use:
  * ACTUAL scores (statSourceId=0) for weeks < CURRENT_NFL_WEEK
  * PROJECTED values (statSourceId=1) for weeks >= CURRENT_NFL_WEEK
- players_projected.csv week columns should ALWAYS use:
  * PROJECTED values (statSourceId=1) for ALL weeks 1-17

REQUIREMENTS:

1. EXTRACT BOTH ACTUAL AND PROJECTED VALUES
   - When fetching player data, extract BOTH statSourceId=0 (actuals) AND statSourceId=1 (projections)
   - Store both sets of values for weeks 1-17 for each player
   - For players.csv:
     * Use actuals (statSourceId=0) for past weeks (week < CURRENT_NFL_WEEK)
     * Use projections (statSourceId=1) for current and future weeks (week >= CURRENT_NFL_WEEK)
   - For players_projected.csv:
     * Use projections (statSourceId=1) for ALL weeks 1-17

2. RECREATE FILE EACH RUN (NOT UPDATE/APPEND)
   - players_projected.csv should be completely regenerated on each fetcher run
   - Follow the same pattern as players.csv (full recreation)
   - Do NOT try to preserve historical weeks or append to existing data
   - This ensures data consistency and avoids the mixed data problem

3. FILE FORMAT
   - Same structure as current: id, name, week_1_points, week_2_points, ..., week_17_points
   - All week columns should contain PROJECTION values (statSourceId=1)
   - This is essentially a projection-only version of player weekly data

4. HISTORICAL DATA SAVING
   - Continue saving to historical_data folder as before
   - Path: data/historical_data/{SEASON}/{WEEK}/players_projected.csv
   - This preserves point-in-time snapshots of projections

5. CODE CHANGES NEEDED
   - Modify espn_client.py:
     * Keep existing _extract_raw_espn_week_points() behavior for actuals (used by players.csv)
     * Add new method to extract statSourceId=1 projection data OR
     * Add parameter to existing method to choose which source to extract
     * Store BOTH actual and projected values in player data model
   - Modify player data model (ESPNPlayerData or similar):
     * Add fields for projected week values (separate from actual week values)
     * e.g., week_1_projected, week_2_projected, etc. OR a separate projected_weeks dict
   - Modify player_data_exporter.py:
     * Update export_projected_points_data() to recreate file from scratch
     * Use the projected values (statSourceId=1) when writing players_projected.csv
   - Update outdated code comments that reference non-existent projectedTotal field

6. UPDATE COMMENTS
   - Fix misleading comments in espn_client.py lines 579-585, 458 that mention projectedTotal
   - Document the correct ESPN API structure:
     * statSourceId=0 + appliedTotal = Actual game scores
     * statSourceId=1 + appliedTotal = ESPN projections

TESTING:
- Verify all week columns contain projection values (not actuals)
- Compare output against ESPN API to confirm statSourceId=1 values are used
- Verify file is completely regenerated (not appended)
- Verify historical_data saving still works

NOTES:
- ESPN may update projection values over time, so values retrieved today may differ
  slightly from original pre-game projections
- Bye weeks should show 0.0 (ESPN returns 0.0 for statSourceId=1 on bye weeks)
- Future weeks (not yet played) will also have projection data from statSourceId=1
