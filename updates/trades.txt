New trade flow:
- Upon loading in, all the drafted=1 players will be organized into teams based on the drafted_data.csv file. Lots of pre-processing here.
- Pick between getting a trade suggestion or manually suggesting a trade 
- If doing trade suggestion:
    - Will ask the player to pick a team to be trading with
    - Will go through all 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 potential trades
    - Will display trades that increase the player's total calculated score, and increases the other team's total projected points for the rest of the season.
    - For IR players, will do calculations based on the current roster until reaching the week that the player is suppossed to be back, then the worst player of the matching position will be swapped out for the IR player for the rest of the calculations 
    - Will show all trades that improve both teams
- If doing manual trade:
    - Select the team to trade with
    - The same previous simulation except include the ability to do 1:2 and 2:1 trades and show how the other team's projected points will change
