Update the consistency calculation to be a 'performance' metric
The player gets a >1.0 multiplier when they have been outperforming their projected points, and a <1.0 multiplier when they have been underperforming
This will require data on previous projections
Start by copying players.csv into a new file called players_projected.csv. Only copy over the id, name, and week_*_points columns
Look through the 2025_compiled_data folder. Find the versions of players.csv contained in there for weeks 1-6. For the week 1 file, go through every player and set the week_1_points column in players_projected.csv to equal the value contained in the 2025_compiled_data version of the file. Repeat this for weeks 2-6
Update the player_data_fetcher suchc that every time the player_data_fetcher is run, the info for the current week and everything upcoming is updated in that file. For example, if CURRENT_NFL_WEEK=7 then the week_7_points column in the players_projected.csv file will be updated for all players to match what was retrieved for week 7 from the API
Add a ProjectedPointsManager util file in the LeagueHelper. It should be responsible for loading in the projected points data and contain helper functions for accessing the data. It should have at least one helper function that takes in a player as an argument and fetches the projected data for weeks 1 to (CURRENT_NFL_WEEK - 1) as an array. 
The PlayerManager will get the list fetched in the helper function we just described, and get a similar one for all the ACTUAL points scored for weeks 1 to (CURRENT_NFL_WEEK)
We want find just how much the player has been either scoring more or less than their projected points from each week.
The deviation from the projected points will result in a multiplier in the same way as other multiplier scoring methods.
Update the 'consistency' scoring in the League Helper to be 'performance' scoring and make use of the deviation from projected points calculations we described above to get a multiplier to apply alongside other scoring methods like adp and player rating. Follow the conventions of PlayerManager's score_player, the league_config.json, and all other functions already involved in the scoring,
There is no need to maintain backwards compatability for the consistency calculations. Completely replace consistency with the performance.
Default the performance multiplier to be False in the score_player function definition. Set it to be true when the function is called in all places in Starter Helper and Trade Simulation modes
Still have a minimum number of weeks required to be able to apply this multiplier defined in the constants. Default to 3
Add performance to the Simulation in the same way that multipliers like adp and player rating are implrmented.
