Move the FLEX_ELIGIBLE_POSITIONS away from constants.py and into the config.json file
Update the ConfigManager to read in the values
This will let us manipulate it throughout the season depending on the cirumstances while keeping the simulation consistent
be careful to ensure that all places that make use of the FLEX_ELIGIBLE_POSITIONS constant are updated to make use of the config version
For now, keep the FLEX_ELIGIBLE_POSITIONS config the same for all simulation runs. Testing different variations of the FLEX_ELIGIBLE_POSITIONS may be a future enhavement but should not be considerred now
