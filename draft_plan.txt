Roster Needs / Position Scarcity

    Prioritize drafting players at positions where your roster is thin or below the minimum needed.

    Consider how many players you already have at each position and max roster slots.

    Factor in the starting lineup requirements (e.g., you must have at least 1 QB, 2 RBs, etc.) and bench depth for each position.

Player Availability & Position Eligibility

    Only recommend players who are not already drafted (i.e., not in team.csv).

    Respect your position limits — for example, only suggest kickers if you don’t already have one.

Player Quality — ADP and Injury Status

    Use ADP (Average Draft Position) as a proxy for player value; lower ADP usually means a better player.

    Prefer healthy players (exclude or deprioritize injured players).

    Could also consider bye week conflicts (avoid drafting too many players with the same bye week).

Flex Position Considerations

    Remember your flex slot can be RB or WR, so your recommendation can consider those flexibly.

    If you have fewer than required RBs or WRs for starters plus flex, prioritize accordingly.

Team Composition Strategy

    Balance starters vs bench slots — don’t fill your bench with all one position if you have starters missing.

    Possibly weight the importance of positions based on scarcity in the league or your play style.
