# PLAN A: Stream QB + Stream DST (Drop Streaming DST for Hampton)

## Waiver Roadmap

### Pre-Week 14 Waivers (Process before Sunday Dec 7)

| Priority | Drop | Add | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----|-----------|
| **1** | Goedert | **Trevor Lawrence** | Week 14 QB stream vs IND (29th-ranked pass D) instead of Mahomes vs HOU (#1 vs QB) |
| **2** | Gadsden | **Brenton Strange** | TE upgrade - Strange has elite playoff schedule (IND twice, NYJ) |
| **3** | Chargers D/ST | **Streaming DST** | Week 14 DST with favorable matchup |

#### Week 14 Streaming DST Options
- **Browns vs TEN** - Cam Ward, rookie QB, low-scoring game expected
- **Broncos @ LV** - Raiders offense is bad
- **Jaguars vs IND** - Colts offense inconsistent

#### Why Stream Lawrence Week 14
| Metric | Mahomes vs HOU | Lawrence vs IND |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Opponent vs QB rank | #1 (hardest - 12.5 PPG allowed) | ~29th (soft pass D) |
| Expected points | ~14-16 (suppressed) | ~17-22 |
| Rushing upside | Limited | 3 rush TDs in last 4 games |
| Home/Away | Home | Home |

---

### Mid-Week 14 (Hampton IR Activation)

| Drop | Add | Reasoning |
|------|-----|-----------|
| **Streaming DST** | **Activate Hampton** | DST already played Week 14; Hampton returns from IR |

#### Why Streaming DST
- Streaming DST will have already played by mid-week
- Lawrence still needed for Week 14 (can't drop)
- Tracy on BYE but preserved for potential future use
- Consolidates to Texans DST for playoffs anyway

---

### Pre-Week 15 Waivers (Playoff Round 1)

| Priority | Drop | Add | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----|-----------|
| **1** | Lawrence | FLEX depth OR hold spot | One-week QB rental complete |

#### FLEX Depth Options to Consider
- RB handcuff (Irving/Jeanty backup if available)
- High-upside WR for championship week
- Or hold roster steady with open spot

---

## Plan A: Roster Evolution Summary

| Timing | Drop | Add |
|--------|------|-----|
| Pre-Week 14 | Goedert | Trevor Lawrence |
| Pre-Week 14 | Gadsden | Brenton Strange |
| Pre-Week 14 | Chargers D/ST | Streaming DST |
| Mid-Week 14 | Streaming DST | Activate Hampton (IR) |
| Pre-Week 15 | Lawrence | Open/depth |

---

## Plan A: Week 14 Roster

| Pos | Player | Opponent | Start? |
|-----|--------|----------|--------|
| QB | **Lawrence** | vs IND | START (stream) |
| QB | Mahomes | vs HOU | Bench |
| RB | Jeanty | vs DEN | START |
| RB | J. Williams | vs SEA | START |
| RB | Irving | @ NO | FLEX option |
| RB | Tracy | BYE | N/A |
| RB | Hampton | vs PHI | Activate mid-week (after DST plays) |
| WR | Rice | vs CLE | START |
| WR | Waddle | @ NYJ | START |
| WR | J. Williams | @ TEN | FLEX option |
| WR | Wilson | vs CAR | Bench |
| TE | **Strange** | vs IND | START |
| TE | Waller | @ NYJ | Bench (ramping) |
| K | Dicker | vs PHI | START |
| DST | **Streaming** | TBD | START (then drop for Hampton) |
| DST | Texans | vs KC | Bench (bad matchup) |

---

## Plan A: Final Playoff Roster (Week 15+)

| Position | Players |
|----------|---------|
| QB | Mahomes |
| RB | Jeanty, J. Williams, Irving, Hampton, Tracy |
| WR | Rice, Waddle, J. Williams, Wilson |
| TE | Strange, Waller |
| K | Dicker |
| DST | Texans |
| Open | 1 flex spot (from Lawrence drop) |

**Key Difference from Original:** Tracy is preserved; only 1 open roster spot instead of 2.

# PLAN B: No QB Stream, Stream DST Only

## Waiver Roadmap

### Pre-Week 14 Waivers (Process before Sunday Dec 7)

| Priority | Drop | Add | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----|-----------|
| **1** | Goedert | **Brenton Strange** | TE upgrade - Strange has elite playoff schedule (IND twice, NYJ) |
| **2** | Chargers D/ST | **Streaming DST** | Week 14 DST with favorable matchup |

#### Week 14 Streaming DST Options
- **Browns vs TEN** - Cam Ward, rookie QB, low-scoring game expected
- **Broncos @ LV** - Raiders offense is bad
- **Jaguars vs IND** - Colts offense inconsistent

---

### Mid-Week 14 (Hampton IR Activation)

| Drop | Add | Reasoning |
|------|-----|-----------|
| **Streaming DST** | **Activate Hampton** | DST already played Week 14; Hampton returns from IR |

---

### Pre-Week 15 Waivers (Playoff Round 1)

| Priority | Drop | Add | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----|-----------|
| **1** | Gadsden | FLEX depth OR hold spot | No longer need 3 TEs with Strange + Waller |

---

## Plan B: Roster Evolution Summary

| Timing | Drop | Add |
|--------|------|-----|
| Pre-Week 14 | Goedert | Brenton Strange |
| Pre-Week 14 | Chargers D/ST | Streaming DST |
| Mid-Week 14 | Streaming DST | Activate Hampton (IR) |
| Pre-Week 15 | Gadsden | Open/depth |

---

## Plan B: Week 14 Roster

| Pos | Player | Opponent | Start? |
|-----|--------|----------|--------|
| QB | **Mahomes** | vs HOU | START (tough matchup, but trust the talent) |
| RB | Jeanty | vs DEN | START |
| RB | J. Williams | vs SEA | START |
| RB | Irving | @ NO | FLEX option |
| RB | Tracy | BYE | N/A |
| RB | Hampton | vs PHI | Activate mid-week (after DST plays) |
| WR | Rice | vs CLE | START |
| WR | Waddle | @ NYJ | START |
| WR | J. Williams | @ TEN | FLEX option |
| WR | Wilson | vs CAR | Bench |
| TE | **Strange** | vs IND | START |
| TE | Waller | @ NYJ | Bench (ramping) |
| TE | Gadsden | BYE | N/A (drop Week 15) |
| K | Dicker | vs PHI | START |
| DST | **Streaming** | TBD | START (then drop for Hampton) |
| DST | Texans | vs KC | Bench (bad matchup) |

---

## Plan B: Final Playoff Roster (Week 15+)

| Position | Players |
|----------|---------|
| QB | Mahomes |
| RB | Jeanty, J. Williams, Irving, Hampton, Tracy |
| WR | Rice, Waddle, J. Williams, Wilson |
| TE | Strange, Waller |
| K | Dicker |
| DST | Texans |
| Open | 1 flex spot (from Gadsden drop) |

---

## Plan Comparison

| Factor | Plan A (Stream QB + DST) | Plan B (Stream DST Only) |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Week 14 QB | Lawrence vs IND (~17-22 pts) | Mahomes vs HOU (~14-16 pts) |
| Week 14 QB Edge | **+3-6 points** | — |
| Roster Flexibility | 1 open spot | 1 open spot |
| RB Depth | 5 RBs (incl Tracy) | 5 RBs (incl Tracy) |
| Risk | Lawrence boom/bust | Mahomes floor is safe |
| Complexity | 4 transactions | 3 transactions |

### Recommendation

**Plan A is higher upside** - The Texans are genuinely elite vs QBs (#1, 12.5 PPG allowed). Lawrence vs IND's 29th-ranked pass D is a significant upgrade. The extra transaction is worth the ~3-6 projected point gain.

**Plan B is safer** - If you trust Mahomes to overcome any matchup, or don't want to roster a one-week QB rental, this is simpler. You still get Strange + streaming DST + Hampton activation.

| K | Dicker | @ DAL | START |
| DST | Texans | vs KC | START |

---

|-----|--------|----------|--------|
| QB | Mahomes | @ DEN | START |
| RB | Jeanty | @ JAX | START (smash spot) |

---

## Key Strategic Notes

### TE Strategy: Strange + Waller
| Week | Start | Reasoning |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 14 | Strange vs IND | Colts allow 5th-most to TEs |
| 15 | Strange vs NYJ | Jets leaky, home game, must-win |
| 16 | **Waller vs CIN** | Bengals 32nd vs TEs - smash spot |
| 17 | **Waller vs TB** | Bucs defense collapsing |

### QB Strategy
- **Plan A:** Stream Lawrence Week 14 vs IND, Mahomes Weeks 15-17
- **Plan B:** Mahomes all weeks, accept the Week 14 tough matchup

### RB Depth (Both Plans)
You maintain 5 RBs with clear hierarchy:
1. Jeanty (locked RB1)
2. J. Williams (RB2)
3. Irving (FLEX/RB2 when healthy)
4. Hampton (depth, brutal schedule)
5. Tracy (preserved, Week 17 @ LV is usable)
