# Fantasy Football Waiver Roadmap - PLAYOFFS FOCUS (Weeks 15-17, 2025)

*Created: November 28, 2025*
*Last Updated: December 3, 2025 (Twentieth update: Major matchup verification - corrected WR/TE defense rankings)*
*Playoff Seed: 4th (Locked in - Week 14 irrelevant for seeding)*

---

## 🎯 PLAYOFF SITUATION (Updated Dec 2, 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Playoff Probability** | 100% - LOCKED IN |
| **1st/2nd Seed Probability** | 0% - Cannot achieve bye week |
| **Week 14 Impact** | NONE - Results don't affect seeding |
| **Focus** | **WEEKS 15-17 ONLY** - Optimize roster for playoff matchups |

**Strategy Shift:** Since Week 14 has no bearing on playoff seeding, ALL waiver decisions should be optimized for **Weeks 15-17 playoff schedule strength**. Week 14 starters should prioritize rest/health over wins.

---

## UPDATE (Dec 2, 2025) - TYRONE TRACY STATUS

**Tracy's injury was just a hip contusion/stinger** - he will be fine. The Week 14 BYE provides extra rest, and he should be fully healthy for the playoffs.

**No RB contingency needed** - Tracy remains a startable RB for Weeks 15-17.

## ⚠️ MAJOR UPDATE (Dec 3, 2025) - MATCHUP VERIFICATION & TE STRATEGY

### Defense Rankings Corrections

After verifying against Pro-Football-Reference data, several matchup assessments were **INCORRECT**:

#### WR Defense Rankings (Fantasy Points Allowed - Higher = Worse Defense)
| Rank | Team | FP Allowed | Matchup Grade |
|------|------|------------|---------------|
| #1 | Cowboys (DAL) | 336.10 | **SMASH** |
| #2 | Giants (NYG) | 314.10 | **SMASH** |
| #5 | Bears (CHI) | 293.70 | **Great** |
| #6 | Titans (TEN) | 285.10 | **Good** |
| #8 | Raiders (LV) | 278.90 | **Good** |
| #9 | Patriots (NE) | 273.50 | **Good** |
| #10 | 49ers (SF) | 269.50 | Neutral |
| #11 | Ravens (BAL) | 267.50 | Neutral |
| #12 | Jaguars (JAX) | 238.00 | Neutral |
| #13 | Saints (NO) | 232.60 | Neutral |
| #14 | Panthers (CAR) | 228.00 | Neutral |
| #16 | Jets (NYJ) | 218.00 | Slightly Tough |
| #17 | Seahawks (SEA) | 207.20 | Tough |
| #28+ | Broncos (DEN) | 181.00 | **TOUGH** |
| #28+ | Chargers (LAC) | 182.62 | **TOUGH** |

#### TE Defense Rankings (Fantasy Points Allowed - Higher = Worse Defense)
| Rank | Team | FP Allowed | Matchup Grade |
|------|------|------------|---------------|
| #1 | Bengals (CIN) | 188.70 | **SMASH** (historically bad) |
| #4 | Commanders (WAS) | 119.40 | **Good** |
| #6 | Steelers (PIT) | 116.70 | **Good** |
| #15 | Jets (NYJ) | 98.10 | Neutral |
| #17 | Saints (NO) | 96.30 | Neutral |
| #18 | Buccaneers (TB) | 94.80 | Neutral |
| #19 | Cowboys (DAL) | 94.20 | Neutral |
| #21 | Giants (NYG) | 89.96 | Slightly Tough |
| #26 | Chiefs (KC) | 76.30 | Tough |
| #27 | Texans (HOU) | 70.10 | Tough |
| #29 | Raiders (LV) | 64.60 | **TOUGH** |
| #30 | Eagles (PHI) | 60.10 | **TOUGH** |

### Key Matchup Corrections

**Mitchell (NYJ) - DOWNGRADED from A+ to B+:**
- Week 15 @ JAX: Was "SMASH" → Actually **Neutral** (#12 - 238 pts)
- Week 16 @ NO: Was "SMASH" → Actually **Neutral** (#13 - 232 pts)
- Week 17 vs NE: Was "SMASH" → Actually **Good** (#9 - 273 pts)
- *Still the best FLEX option due to volume and consistency*

**Watson (GB) - Week 16 UPGRADED:**
- Week 16 @ CHI: Was "Neutral" → Actually **GREAT** (#5 - 293 pts)
- Watson has the only truly elite matchup among FLEX options

**Vele (NO) - CORRECTED:**
- Week 15 vs CAR: Was "SMASH" → Actually **Neutral** (#14 - 228 pts)
- Week 16 vs NYJ: Was "Good" → Actually **Slightly Tough** (#16 - 218 pts)
- Week 17 @ TEN: Was "Neutral" → Actually **Good** (#6 - 285 pts)

**Pierce (IND) - CORRECTED:**
- Week 16 vs SF: Was "Tough" → Actually **Neutral** (#10 - 269 pts)
- Week 17 vs JAX: Was "SMASH" → Actually **Neutral** (#12 - 238 pts)

**Higgins (HOU) - SCHEDULE ERROR FIXED:**
- Week 16: Was "@ LV" → Actually **vs LV (HOME)** - Good matchup (#8)
- Week 17: Was "vs LAC" → Actually **@ LAC (AWAY)** - TOUGH matchup (#28+)

### Waller Schedule Re-Evaluation

**Waller's playoff schedule is BETTER than originally assessed:**

| Week | Opponent | Original | Corrected |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 14 | @ NYJ | Neutral | Neutral (#15) |
| 15 | vs PIT | "Tough" | **Good** (#6 - Steelers 5th worst vs TEs!) |
| 16 | vs CIN | SMASH | **SMASH** (#1 - historically bad) |
| 17 | vs TB | Neutral | Neutral (#18) |

**Waller-Only Strategy is Viable:**
- Waller beats Gadsden in every single week
- Waller beats Theo Johnson in 3 of 4 weeks (only marginally worse Week 15)
- Even Ertz provides minimal value over Waller (never clearly better on matchups)
- **Consider: Skip backup TE, use roster spot for 3rd FLEX instead**

---

## CRITICAL UPDATE (Nov 29, 2025 - Updated Dec 2)

**Brenton Strange has been claimed by another team.** TE strategy updated: **Zach Ertz (WSH)** is now the primary target over Theo Johnson.

**Key Changes:**
- **Ertz > Johnson** - Better QB (Daniels vs Dart), better recent form (10/106 Wk13), no Week 14 BYE issue. Note: Both teams tanking (WSH 3-9, NYG 2-10)
- **No longer streaming QB** - Mahomes starts all weeks (simplified to single plan)
- **Browns D/ST** dropped Pre-Week 14 for second FLEX (not holding for Week 14)
- Pre-Week 14: Drop Goedert for **FLEX** (Mitchell), Drop Gadsden for **TE** (Ertz)
- Complete waiver claim queue added with 12 claims and backup options

---

## TL;DR - Priority Waiver Moves (PLAYOFF-OPTIMIZED)

*All priorities now based on Weeks 15-17 schedule strength, NOT Week 14.*

### Must Add (CORRECTED DEC 3)
| Priority | Player | Position | Playoff Schedule | Backup Options |
|----------|--------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **1** | **Adonai Mitchell (NYJ)** | FLEX | **B+ (volume king, neutral matchups)** | Watson > Vele > Higgins > Pierce |
| **2** | **Evan McPherson (CIN)** | K | **A (Wk17 HOME vs ARI)** | Keep Dicker if unavailable |
| **3** | **Additional FLEX** | FLEX | See backup order above | Use Gadsden slot for 3rd FLEX |

**Strategy Update (Dec 3):**
- Mitchell's matchups are NOT elite (JAX/NO are #12/#13, not smash spots) - but he's still #1 due to volume (30% target share)
- **Waller-only TE strategy is viable** - Waller has better matchups than Ertz/Johnson every week
- Consider skipping backup TE entirely, use roster spot for 3rd FLEX lottery ticket
- Watson has the only truly GREAT matchup (Wk16 @ CHI)

### Must Drop
| Priority | Player | When | Why |
|----------|--------|------|-----|
| **1** | Goedert | Pre-Week 14 | 4 straight duds, TD regression |
| **2** | Gadsden | Pre-Week 14 | Don't need 3 TEs, use slot for FLEX |
| **3** | Dicker | Pre-Week 14 | Herbert hand surgery risk |
| **4** | Browns D/ST | Pre-Week 14 | Week 14 doesn't matter - grab extra FLEX now |
| **5** | TBD | When Hampton ready | Drop weakest player when activating Hampton |

### Timeline
| When | Drop | Add |
|------|------|-----|
| **Pre-Week 14** | Goedert | Adonai Mitchell (FLEX #1) |
| **Pre-Week 14** | Gadsden | Zach Ertz (TE) |
| **Pre-Week 14** | Dicker | Evan McPherson |
| **Pre-Week 14** | Browns D/ST | Mitchell/Pierce/Watson/Vele (FLEX #2) |
| **When Hampton ready** | TBD (weakest player) | Activate Hampton (IR) |

**Strategy Change:** Since Week 14 is meaningless for seeding, we drop Browns D/ST NOW for a second FLEX option instead of waiting. This gives us two lottery tickets for the playoffs. When Hampton is ready to activate, we evaluate who the weakest roster player is at that time.

## 📋 WAIVER CLAIM QUEUE (Priority 5 of 10, Rolling)

*Submit claims in this exact order. Each successful claim drops you to Priority 10.*

### Complete Claim List

| # | Add | Drop | Purpose |
|---|-----|------|---------|
| 1 | **Evan McPherson** | Cameron Dicker | Kicker (no backup - keep Dicker if fails) |
| 2 | **Adonai Mitchell** | Dallas Goedert | FLEX #1 primary |
| 3 | **Zach Ertz** | Oronde Gadsden II | TE primary |
| 4 | **Devaughn Vele** | Dallas Goedert | FLEX #1 backup 1 |
| 5 | **Theo Johnson** | Oronde Gadsden II | TE backup |
| 6 | **Devaughn Vele** | Browns D/ST | FLEX #2 primary |
| 7 | **Alec Pierce** | Dallas Goedert | FLEX #1 backup 2 |
| 8 | **Alec Pierce** | Browns D/ST | FLEX #2 backup 1 |
| 9 | **Christian Watson** | Dallas Goedert | FLEX #1 backup 3 |
| 10 | **Christian Watson** | Browns D/ST | FLEX #2 backup 2 |
| 11 | **Jayden Higgins** | Browns D/ST | FLEX #2 backup 3 |

### Claim Flow Diagram

```
KICKER (Drop Dicker):
  1. McPherson ──→ (keep Dicker if fails)

FLEX #1 (Drop Goedert):
  2. Mitchell ──→ 4. Vele ──→ 7. Pierce ──→ 9. Watson

TE (Drop Gadsden):
  3. Ertz ──→ 5. Johnson

FLEX #2 (Drop Browns):
  6. Vele ──→ 8. Pierce ──→ 10. Watson ──→ 11. Higgins
```

### How Rolling Priority Works

- **Start at Priority 5 of 10** - decent position
- Each successful claim drops you to Priority 10
- Failed claims (player already taken) keep your current priority
- Use P5 on most contested player (McPherson - kickers heavily streamed)

### Scenario Outcomes

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| All primary claims succeed | McPherson, Mitchell, Ertz, Vele (for FLEX #2) |
| McPherson taken by P1-4 | Keep Dicker, stay P5 for Mitchell |
| Mitchell taken | Vele becomes FLEX #1 AND FLEX #2 primary |
| Ertz taken | Johnson becomes TE |
| Worst case | Still guaranteed SOME kicker (or Dicker), SOME FLEX, SOME TE |

## 📊 WEEKS 15-17 PLAYOFF SCHEDULE STRENGTH ANALYSIS

*This is the most critical section - all waiver targets must be evaluated by their Weeks 15-17 schedule, NOT Week 14.*

### Waiver Target Schedule Comparison (Weeks 15-17) - CORRECTED DEC 3

| Player | Position | Week 15 | Week 16 | Week 17 | Overall Grade |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Adonai Mitchell** | WR | @ JAX ⚠️ | @ NO ⚠️ | vs NE ✅ | **B+ (Consistent)** |
| **Evan McPherson** | K | vs BAL ⚠️ | @ MIA ✅ | vs ARI ✅ | **A (Excellent)** |
| **Zach Ertz** | TE | @ NYG ⚠️ | vs PHI ❌ | vs DAL ⚠️ | **C+ (Waller better)** |
| **Theo Johnson** | TE | vs WSH ✅ | vs MIN ⚠️ | @ LV ❌ | **C (Wk17 brutal)** |
| **Alec Pierce** | WR | @ SEA ❌ | vs SF ⚠️ | vs JAX ⚠️ | **C (No smash spots)** |
| **Christian Watson** | WR | @ DEN ❌ | @ CHI ✅ | vs BAL ⚠️ | **B- (Wk16 great)** |
| **Devaughn Vele** | WR | vs CAR ⚠️ | vs NYJ ❌ | @ TEN ✅ | **C+ (Wk17 good)** |
| **Jayden Higgins** | WR | vs ARI ⚠️ | vs LV ✅ | @ LAC ❌ | **C+ (Wk17 brutal)** |
| **Darren Waller** | TE | vs PIT ✅ | vs CIN ✅✅ | vs TB ⚠️ | **A- (Best TE)** |

**Legend:** ✅ = Favorable | ✅✅ = SMASH | ⚠️ = Neutral | ❌ = Tough

**Key Insight:** Waller has the best TE schedule. No backup TE clearly improves the lineup.

### Schedule Breakdown by Round

#### Week 15 (Playoff Round 1 - MUST WIN) - CORRECTED
| Target | Opponent | Matchup Analysis |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Mitchell** | @ JAX | Neutral (#12 - 238 pts) - JAX is mid-tier, not a smash spot |
| **McPherson** | vs BAL | Rivalry game = FG volume. Bengals will need FGs vs elite Ravens |
| **Waller** | vs PIT | **Good** (#6 - 116 pts) - Steelers are 5th worst vs TEs! |
| **Watson** | @ DEN | **TOUGH** (#28+ - 181 pts) - Broncos best vs WRs |
| **Vele** | vs CAR | Neutral (#14 - 228 pts) - Panthers are mid-tier, not a smash |
| **Pierce** | @ SEA | Tough (#17 - 207 pts) - Seahawks solid, road game |
| **Higgins** | vs ARI | Neutral (#15 - 221 pts) - Cardinals middle of pack |

#### Week 16 (Playoff Round 2) - CORRECTED
| Target | Opponent | Matchup Analysis |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Waller** | vs CIN | **SMASH** (#1 - 188 pts) - Bengals historically awful vs TEs (13 TDs allowed!) |
| **Watson** | @ CHI | **GREAT** (#5 - 293 pts) - Bears 5th worst vs WRs |
| **Mitchell** | @ NO | Neutral (#13 - 232 pts) - Saints mid-tier |
| **McPherson** | @ MIA | Good - Shootout potential, Dolphins soft defense |
| **Higgins** | vs LV | **Good** (#8 - 278 pts) - HOME game, Raiders 8th worst vs WRs |
| **Pierce** | vs SF | Neutral (#10 - 269 pts) - 49ers mid-tier, not tough |
| **Vele** | vs NYJ | Slightly Tough (#16 - 218 pts) - Jets defense not as bad as record suggests |

#### Week 17 (Championship) - CORRECTED
| Target | Opponent | Matchup Analysis |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Mitchell** | vs NE | **Good** (#9 - 273 pts) - Patriots allow 9th most to WRs |
| **McPherson** | vs ARI | **CHAMPIONSHIP CEILING** - HOME game, bad defense, Burrow elite |
| **Vele** | @ TEN | **Good** (#6 - 285 pts) - Titans 6th worst vs WRs |
| **Watson** | vs BAL | Neutral (#11 - 267 pts) - Ravens mid-tier, not as tough as thought |
| **Waller** | vs TB | Neutral (#18 - 94 pts) - Bucs middle of pack vs TEs |
| **Pierce** | vs JAX | Neutral (#12 - 238 pts) - JAX mid-tier, not a smash |
| **Higgins** | @ LAC | **TOUGH** (#28+ - 182 pts) - Chargers elite vs WRs, road game |

### Key Schedule Insights - CORRECTED DEC 3

**BEST Playoff Schedules:**
1. **Darren Waller** - PIT(Good)/CIN(SMASH)/TB(Neutral) = Best TE schedule by far
2. **Evan McPherson** - Week 17 vs ARI is the ultimate championship spot (HOME game)
3. **Christian Watson** - Week 16 @ CHI is the only truly GREAT WR matchup among FLEX options

**CORRECTED - NOT AS GOOD AS THOUGHT:**
1. **Adonai Mitchell** - JAX/NO are actually mid-tier (#12/#13), not smash spots. Still best due to volume.
2. **Alec Pierce** - Week 17 vs JAX is neutral (#12), not a smash spot
3. **Devaughn Vele** - CAR/NYJ are neutral/tough, only Week 17 @ TEN is good

**WORST Playoff Schedules:**
1. **Watson Week 15** - @ DEN is brutal (Broncos best vs WRs)
2. **Higgins Week 17** - @ LAC is brutal (Chargers 2nd best vs WRs, road game)
3. **Pierce Week 15** - @ SEA is tough (Seahawks solid)

**SCHEDULE-ADJUSTED PRIORITY (CORRECTED):**
| Rank | Player | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| **1** | Darren Waller | Best TE schedule - Wk15 good, Wk16 SMASH, no backup needed |
| **2** | Evan McPherson | Week 17 HOME vs ARI is league-winning |
| **3** | Adonai Mitchell | Most consistent (3 neutral-to-good weeks), highest volume |
| **4** | Christian Watson | Only player with a GREAT matchup (Wk16 @ CHI), boom/bust |
| **5** | Jayden Higgins | Good Wk16 (vs LV), but brutal Wk17 (@ LAC) |
| **6** | Devaughn Vele | Good Wk17 (@ TEN), but bad team/QB |
| **7** | Alec Pierce | No great matchups anymore (JAX is neutral, not smash) |

### ⚠️ CRITICAL RISK: Garrett Wilson Return

**Garrett Wilson (Jets, knee)** is eligible to return from IR. Current expectation is **Week 15 or 16**.

**Impact on Mitchell:**
- If Wilson returns Week 15: Mitchell becomes boom/bust WR4
- If Wilson stays out (Jets 3-9, may shut him down): Mitchell remains WR1

**Recommendation:** Add Mitchell now regardless. Even with Wilson back, Mitchell showed WR1 talent (8/102/1). If Wilson returns, you have Watson/Vele as backups.

---

## Current Roster (Post-Week 13)

| Position | Player | Team | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| QB | Patrick Mahomes | KC | ACTIVE | Starter all weeks - trust the talent |
| RB | Ashton Jeanty | LV | ACTIVE | RB1 |
| RB | Javonte Williams | DAL | ACTIVE | RB2 |
| RB | Bucky Irving | TB | ACTIVE | Week 13: 17 carries, 61 yds, 1 TD + 2/20 receiving. Lead back role restored |
| RB | Tyrone Tracy Jr. | NYG | ACTIVE | Hip contusion (minor) - will be fine. BYE Week 14 for extra rest. |
| RB | Omarion Hampton | LAC | IR (DTR) | RULED OUT Week 13, targets Week 14 @ PHI return, timeshare with Vidal |
| WR | Rashee Rice | KC | ACTIVE | WR1 |
| WR | Jaylen Waddle | MIA | ACTIVE | WR2 |

| K | Cameron Dicker | LAC | ACTIVE | **CONCERN:** Herbert hand surgery - may miss Week 14, Trey Lance backup |
| DST | Texans D/ST | HOU | ACTIVE | Playoff starter |
| DST | Browns D/ST | CLE | ACTIVE | START Week 14 vs TEN, then DROP for Hampton |

# WAIVER PLAN: Mahomes All Weeks + FLEX Upgrade

## Waiver Roadmap

### Pre-Week 14 Waivers (Process before Sunday Dec 7)

#### TE Targets (Priority Order)
| Priority | Drop | Add | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----|-----------|
| **1** | Gadsden | **Zach Ertz (WSH)** | 49 rec, 493 yds, 4 TDs. Week 13: 10/106. Better QB (Daniels), no Week 14 BYE issue. Note: WSH 3-9 |
| **2** | Gadsden | **Theo Johnson (NYG)** | Backup option - 39 rec, 427 yds, 5 TDs, but Week 13 only 5.9 pts. Giants 2-10 with rookie QB, Week 14 BYE |

| **Drop** | Goedert | **Adonai Mitchell** | Drop underperforming TE for FLEX upgrade |

**Note:** Since Week 14 is meaningless for playoff seeding, we're dropping Browns D/ST NOW for a second FLEX option (Vele). Texans D/ST is the only DST needed for playoffs.

---

### Hampton IR Activation (When Ready)

| Drop | Add | Reasoning |
|------|-----|-----------|
| **TBD (weakest player)** | **Activate Hampton** | Evaluate roster when Hampton is healthy - likely drop Vele or Michael Wilson depending on performance |

**Candidates to drop for Hampton:**
1. **Devaughn Vele** - If his breakout doesn't continue
2. **Michael Wilson** - Low floor, inconsistent targets
3. **Darren Waller** - If Johnson proves reliable enough as solo TE

---

### Pre-Week 14 FLEX Target (Drop Goedert)

#### FLEX Targets (Priority Order) - UPDATED DEC 2
| Priority | Drop | Add | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----|-----------|
| **1** | Goedert | **Adonai Mitchell (NYJ)** | Week 13 BREAKOUT: 8/102/1 TD (career day!), Jets WR1 (Wilson eligible Wk15 but may be shut down), A+ schedule |
| **2** | Goedert | **Alec Pierce (IND)** | Week 13 BOUNCE BACK: 4/78/1 TD, Week 17 vs JAX is SMASH spot for championship |
| **3** | Goedert | **Christian Watson (GB)** | Week 13: 4/80/1 TD (51-yard bomb), but brutal Weeks 15/17 (DEN, BAL) |
| **4** | Goedert | **Devaughn Vele (NO)** | Week 13: 8/93/1 TD, but Saints 2-10 with rookie QB |
| **5** | Goedert | **Jayden Higgins (HOU)** | Week 13: 5/65/0, WR2 behind Nico Collins, Stroud back healthy |

#### FLEX Streaming Comparison - UPDATED WEEK 13

| Player | Team | Fantasy Pts | Recent Form | Playoff Schedule (Wk14-17) |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Adonai Mitchell** | NYJ | ~35 | Wk13: 8/102/1 TD (BREAKOUT!) | vs MIA, vs JAX, vs NO, vs NE |
| **Devaughn Vele** | NO | 37.7 | Wk13: 8/93/1 TD (BREAKOUT!) | @TB, vs CAR, vs NYJ, @TEN |
| **Christian Watson** | GB | 58.3 | Wk13: 4/80/1 TD (51-yard bomb) | vs CHI, @ DEN, @ CHI, vs BAL |
| **Alec Pierce** | IND | ~67 | Wk13: 4/78/1 TD (bounce back!) | @JAX, @SEA, vs SF, vs JAX |
| **Jayden Higgins** | HOU | ~38 | Wk13: 5/65/0 (solid, no TD) | vs IND, vs ARI, vs LV, @ LAC |
| **John Metchie** | NYJ | 31.1 | Wk13: 4/19/0 (DUD) | vs MIA, vs JAX, vs NO, vs NE |
| **Chris Godwin** | TB | 41.0 | Wk12: 2/9 (ramping up) | @NO, @ATL, @CAR, vs MIA |

**Mitchell Pros:** Week 13 BREAKOUT (8/102/1 career day), clearly Jets WR1 now (Metchie was 4/19), easiest playoff schedule (MIA, JAX, NO, NE)
**Mitchell Cons:** Small sample (3 games with Jets), Tyrod Taylor at QB, Wilson eligible to return Week 15 (but Jets 3-9, may shut him down)

**Watson Pros:** Week 13 breakout (4/80/1 with 51-yard TD), big-play ability, Packers playoff push, favorable vs CHI (2x)
**Watson Cons:** Boom/bust, tough @ DEN Week 15 (road game), Jayden Reed and Matthew Golden may return (crowding targets)

**Pierce Pros:** Week 13 BOUNCE BACK (4/78/1 TD), favorable @JAX Week 14/17
**Pierce Cons:** Daniel Jones inconsistent, tough SF matchup Week 16, @SEA Week 15 risky

**Higgins Pros:** Steady target share (7+ targets in 4 of last 5), Stroud back healthy, 4 TDs in 11 games (2nd most for HOU rookie WR)
**Higgins Cons:** WR2 behind Nico Collins (who got the TD Week 13), touchdown dependent, lower ceiling

**Metchie Cons:** Week 13 proved he's NOT the Jets WR1 - Mitchell got 8/102/1, Metchie only 4/19/0

**Vele Pros:** Week 13 BREAKOUT (8/93/1 with 100% catch rate), 6'5" target, <1% rostered, favorable Weeks 15-16 (CAR, NYJ)
**Vele Cons:** Saints are 2-10, rookie QB Tyler Shough, small sample (2 good games), Saints offense is bad

**Godwin Cons:** NOW WR2 behind Egbuka (24.6% target share), Week 12 return was only 2/9/36% snaps

**PLAYOFF SCHEDULE-BASED RECOMMENDATION (CORRECTED DEC 3):**
| Rank | Player | Weeks 15-17 Schedule | Grade |
|------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| **1** | **Adonai Mitchell** | @ JAX ⚠️ / @ NO ⚠️ / vs NE ✅ | **B+** (volume king) |
| **2** | **Christian Watson** | @ DEN ❌ / @ CHI ✅✅ / vs BAL ⚠️ | **B-** (Wk16 GREAT) |
| **3** | **Jayden Higgins** | vs ARI ⚠️ / vs LV ✅ / @ LAC ❌ | **C+** (Wk17 brutal) |
| **4** | **Devaughn Vele** | vs CAR ⚠️ / vs NYJ ❌ / @ TEN ✅ | **C+** (Wk17 good) |
| **5** | **Alec Pierce** | @ SEA ❌ / vs SF ⚠️ / vs JAX ⚠️ | **C** (no great spots) |

**Mitchell is still #1** - not because of elite matchups (they're actually neutral), but because of volume (30% target share, WR1 role). Watson has the only truly GREAT matchup (Wk16 @ CHI). Pierce dropped significantly - JAX is not a smash spot.

---

### Kicker Analysis - DICKER REPLACEMENT (Added Dec 1, 2025)

#### The Problem with Dicker
- **Justin Herbert fractured his left hand** Week 13 vs Raiders, needs surgery
- Herbert may miss Week 14 vs Eagles - Trey Lance would start
- If Lance starts, Chargers offense declines significantly = fewer Dicker opportunities
- Dicker's value is tied to Herbert's health

#### Week 13 Kicker Results
| Kicker | Team | Week 13 Performance | Season Stats |
|--------|------|---------------------|--------------|
| **McPherson** | CIN | **6/6 FG, 2 PAT (~22 pts)** | 23/26 FG, 27/27 PAT |
| Lutz | DEN | BYE (Wk11: 5/5 FG, POTW) | 17/20 FG, 24/24 PAT |
| Folk | NYJ | ~10 pts | 23/24 FG (95.7%), 15/15 PAT |
| Butker | KC | 4/4 PAT, 0 FG | 21/24 FG |
| Boswell | PIT | ~4 pts (26-7 loss) | ~106 season pts |
| Dicker | LAC | ~8 pts | 23 FGM |

#### Kicker Targets (Priority Order)
| Priority | Drop | Add | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----|-----------|
| **1** | Dicker | **Evan McPherson (CIN)** | Week 13 MONSTER (6/6 FGs). Burrow is QB2 since Week 9. 8+ pts in 5 of last 6. Week 17 HOME vs ARI is championship gold |
| **2** | Dicker | **Wil Lutz (DEN)** | AFC Special Teams POTW (Week 11). 4 game-winners (leads NFL). Payton offense = FG volume |
| **3** | Dicker | **Nick Folk (NYJ)** | 23/24 FGs (95.7%), 15/15 PATs. Easiest schedule (MIA, JAX, NO, NE). Low ceiling but rock-solid floor |

#### Kicker Playoff Schedule Comparison
| Kicker | Week 14 | Week 15 | Week 16 | Week 17 | Best Week |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **McPherson** | vs BUF (tough) | vs BAL (tough) | @ MIA (good) | **vs ARI (HOME)** | Wk17 |
| **Lutz** | vs LV (dome) | vs GB | vs JAX (good) | vs KC (tough) | Wk14/16 |
| **Folk** | vs MIA (good) | **vs JAX** | vs NO (good) | **vs NE** | Wk15/17 |
| Dicker | vs PHI (tough + Herbert?) | vs KC (tough) | vs DAL (good) | vs HOU (good) | Wk16/17 |

#### Downgraded Kickers (Avoid)
| Kicker | Team | Concern |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Boswell** | PIT | Rodgers has multiple wrist fractures, Steelers scored 7 pts Week 13, lost 4 of 6 |
| **Butker** | KC | Chiefs 6-6, playoff hopes fading (37%), 1-6 in one-score games |
| **Carlson** | LV | Struggling (16/21 FGs = 76%), missed game-winners, Raiders added competition |

#### Kicker Recommendation
**McPherson is the top target.** Burrow is playing elite (QB2 since Week 9), McPherson is on fire (8+ pts in 5 of 6), and the Week 17 HOME vs ARI matchup is a great championship spot.

**Lutz is the safe pick** - 4 game-winners, Sean Payton's conservative offense generates FG volume.

**Folk has the best schedule** (MIA, JAX, NO, NE) but Jets offense is anemic - low ceiling.

**Risk with McPherson:** Bengals are 4-8. If eliminated, Burrow could shut it down. But Burrow has said he's playing regardless.

## Roster Evolution Summary

| Timing | Drop | Add | Priority Backups |
|--------|------|-----|------------------|
| Pre-Week 14 | Goedert | **Adonai Mitchell** | Vele > Pierce > Watson |
| Pre-Week 14 | Gadsden | **Zach Ertz** | Theo Johnson |
| Pre-Week 14 | Dicker | **Evan McPherson** | Keep Dicker if unavailable |
| Pre-Week 14 | Browns D/ST | **FLEX #2** | Vele > Pierce > Watson > Higgins |
| When Hampton ready | TBD | Activate Hampton (IR) | - |

**Why grab 2 FLEX players now:** Week 14 is meaningless for seeding. Rather than hold Browns D/ST for one useless game, we grab a second FLEX lottery ticket. This maximizes upside for Weeks 15-17.

**Why Ertz over Johnson:** Better QB (Jayden Daniels vs UDFA Jaxon Dart), better recent form (10/106 Wk13 vs Johnson's 5.9 pts), no Week 14 BYE issue. Both teams are tanking (WSH 3-9, NYG 2-10). Week 16 Ertz has tough PHI matchup - start Waller vs CIN instead.

---

## Week 14 Roster (Throwaway Week - Focus on Rest/Health)

*Week 14 has no impact on playoff seeding. Prioritize player health over wins.*

| Pos | Player | Opponent | Start? |
|-----|--------|----------|--------|
| QB | **Mahomes** | vs HOU | **START** (tough matchup, but trust the talent) |
| RB | Jeanty | vs DEN | START |
| RB | J. Williams | @ DET (TNF) | START |
| RB | Irving | @ NO | FLEX option |
| RB | Tracy | BYE | N/A |
| RB | Hampton | vs PHI | IR - monitor status |
| WR | Rice | vs HOU | START |
| WR | Waddle | @ NYJ | START |
| WR | J. Williams | vs DAL | FLEX option |
| WR | Wilson | vs LAR | Bench |
| WR | **Mitchell** | vs MIA | FLEX option (new add) |
| WR | **Vele** | @ TB | Bench (new add - tough matchup) |
| TE | **Ertz** | vs NO | **START** (new add, good matchup) |
| TE | Waller | @ NYJ | Backup option |
| K | **McPherson** | vs BUF | START (tough matchup, but hot streak) |
| DST | **Texans** | vs KC | START (only DST now - bad matchup but no choice) |

---

## Final Playoff Roster (Week 15+)

| Position | Players |
|----------|---------|
| QB | Mahomes |
| RB | Jeanty, J. Williams, Irving, Hampton, Tracy |
| WR | Rice, Waddle, J. Williams, Wilson, **A. Mitchell**, **Vele** |
| TE | **Zach Ertz**, Waller |
| K | **McPherson** |
| DST | Texans |

**Key Notes:**
- Mahomes starts all weeks - no QB streaming
- Ertz replaces Goedert (better team/QB than Johnson)
- Tracy healthy (hip contusion was minor)
- **Two FLEX adds:** Mitchell (A+ schedule) + second FLEX from claim queue
- Hampton activates when healthy - drop weakest player at that time
- Only 1 DST (Texans) - Browns dropped for FLEX since Week 14 is meaningless

## Key Strategic Notes

### TE Strategy: Waller-Only is Viable (UPDATED DEC 3)

**Waller's Corrected Schedule:**
| Week | Opponent | Defense Rank | Matchup |
|------|----------|--------------|---------|
| 14 | @ NYJ | #15 (98 pts) | Neutral |
| 15 | vs PIT | #6 (116 pts) | **Good** (Steelers 5th worst vs TEs!) |
| 16 | vs CIN | #1 (188 pts) | **SMASH** (Bengals historically bad) |
| 17 | vs TB | #18 (94 pts) | Neutral |

**Why Waller-Only Works:**
- Waller beats Gadsden in every single week (Gadsden faces KC #26, HOU #27)
- Waller beats Johnson in 3 of 4 weeks (Johnson has brutal Wk17 @ LV #29)
- Ertz never clearly beats Waller on matchups (both neutral Wk14/17, Waller better Wk15/16)
- **Using Gadsden slot for 3rd FLEX provides more upside than backup TE insurance**

**If You Still Want Backup TE:**
- Ertz > Johnson (Ertz has neutral Wk17 vs DAL, Johnson has brutal Wk17 @ LV)
- But neither is worth the roster spot over a FLEX lottery ticket

### QB Strategy
- **Mahomes all weeks** - trust the talent even in tough matchups
- Week 14 vs HOU is difficult (#1 vs QBs) but Mahomes' floor is safe

### DST Strategy
- **Week 14:** Texans vs KC (tough matchup, but only DST - Week 14 doesn't matter anyway)
- **Week 15+:** Texans only (Browns dropped Pre-Week 14 for Vele)

### Kicker Strategy: McPherson over Dicker (NEW)
| Week | Start | Opponent | Reasoning |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| 14 | **McPherson** | vs BUF | Tough matchup but McPherson on fire (6/6 FG Week 13) |
| 15 | **McPherson** | vs BAL | Rivalry game, Bengals will need FGs to stay competitive |
| 16 | **McPherson** | vs MIA | Good matchup, Dolphins defense is soft |
| 17 | **McPherson** | vs ARI | **SMASH SPOT** - HOME game, bad defense, championship ceiling |

**Why McPherson over Dicker:**
- Herbert (LAC) has fractured hand, may miss Week 14 - Dicker's value tanks if Lance starts
- McPherson is hottest kicker in NFL (6/6 FGs Week 13, 8+ pts in 5 of 6 games)
- Burrow playing elite (QB2 since Week 9) = high-powered offense
- Week 17 HOME vs ARI is perfect championship matchup

### FLEX Streaming Strategy (by Week) - CORRECTED DEC 3

*Matchup grades corrected based on Pro-Football-Reference fantasy points allowed data.*

| Week | Mitchell (NYJ) | Vele (NO) | Watson (GB) | Pierce (IND) | Higgins (HOU) | **Best Start** |
|------|----------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **15** | @ JAX ⚠️ | vs CAR ⚠️ | @ DEN ❌ | @ SEA ❌ | vs ARI ⚠️ | **Mitchell** (volume) |
| **16** | @ NO ⚠️ | vs NYJ ❌ | @ CHI ✅✅ | vs SF ⚠️ | vs LV ✅ | **Watson** (GREAT) or **Higgins** (Good) |
| **17** | vs NE ✅ | @ TEN ✅ | vs BAL ⚠️ | vs JAX ⚠️ | @ LAC ❌ | **Mitchell** or **Vele** (both Good) |

**Key Corrections:**
- JAX/NO/CAR are NOT smash spots - they're mid-tier (#12-14)
- Watson @ CHI Week 16 is the ONLY truly great matchup (Bears #5 worst)
- Higgins has HOME game vs LV Week 16 (was incorrectly listed as away)
- Higgins @ LAC Week 17 is brutal (Chargers #28+ vs WRs)

**If you can only roster ONE:** Mitchell is still the answer - not for matchups (they're neutral), but for volume (30% target share, WR1 role with Wilson out).

### RB Depth
You maintain 5 RBs with clear hierarchy:
1. Jeanty (locked RB1)
2. J. Williams (RB2)
3. Irving (FLEX/RB2 when healthy)
4. Hampton (depth, brutal schedule)
5. Tracy (preserved, Week 17 @ LV is usable)

### Matchup Verification Summary (Dec 3, 2025)

**Major Corrections Made:**

| Player | Week | Original | Corrected |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|
| Mitchell | 15 @ JAX | SMASH | Neutral (#12) |
| Mitchell | 16 @ NO | SMASH | Neutral (#13) |
| Vele | 15 vs CAR | SMASH | Neutral (#14) |
| Vele | 16 vs NYJ | Good | Slightly Tough (#16) |
| Watson | 16 @ CHI | Neutral | **GREAT** (#5) |
| Pierce | 16 vs SF | Tough | Neutral (#10) |
| Pierce | 17 vs JAX | SMASH | Neutral (#12) |
| Higgins | 16 | @ LV | **vs LV (HOME)** |
| Higgins | 17 | vs LAC | **@ LAC (AWAY)** |
| Waller | 15 vs PIT | Tough | **Good** (#6) |
| Johnson | 17 @ LV | Good | **TOUGH** (#29) |

**Key Takeaways:**
1. No FLEX option has truly elite matchups - Mitchell wins on volume, not schedule
2. Watson @ CHI Week 16 is the only GREAT matchup
3. Waller's schedule is better than any backup TE option
4. Higgins Week 17 is brutal (@ LAC), not neutral as originally stated
