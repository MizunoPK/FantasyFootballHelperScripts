# Metric 3: QB-Specific Weather Sensitivity

**Position Applicability:** QB
**Priority:** LOW
**Research Date:** 2025-12-20

---

## 1. Existing Data Analysis

**Can this metric be calculated from existing data?**

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No - Requires historical QB performance in various weather conditions

**Details:**

Some QBs perform worse in cold/wind/rain than others. Requires historical analysis of QB stats by weather condition.

---

## 2. ESPN API Availability

**Is this metric available?**

- [x] No

---

## 3. Free Alternative Sources

### Manual Analysis Required
- Historical QB stats by game
- Weather data for each game
- Calculate performance differential

**Complexity:** High (requires game-by-game weather tracking)

---

## 4-5. Data Quality & Historical Availability

**Reliability:** Low (small sample, many variables)
**Historical:** ⚠️ Limited
**Predictive:** ⚠️ Questionable

---

## 6. Implementation Complexity

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Effort:** 5+ days

---

## 7. Recommendation

**Should we pursue this metric?**

- [ ] **DEFER** - Low priority, complex implementation, questionable value

**Value:** ⭐⭐ (Low - small edge case)
**Feasibility:** ⭐ (Hard)
**Historical:** ⭐ (Limited)

**Rationale:** Weather already covered by Metric 4 (Vegas Lines). QB-specific sensitivity is edge case with limited data.
