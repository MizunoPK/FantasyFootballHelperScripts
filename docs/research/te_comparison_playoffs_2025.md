## Player Profiles

### Dallas Goedert (PHI)

| Target Share | 19.7% | 3rd option behind AJ Brown & DeVonta Smith |
| Red Zone | 7/7 catches, 6 TDs | Elite RZ efficiency |

**Strengths:**
- **7 TDs leads ALL tight ends** (VERIFIED - career high, previous best was 5)
- Perfect 7-of-7 on red zone targets for 6 TDs
- Eagles have **#1 red zone offense in NFL (75-78% TD rate)** (VERIFIED)
- This elite RZ context supports continued TD production

**Weaknesses:**

**TD Sustainability Analysis:**
- 7 TDs on ~45 targets = ~15.5% TD rate (very high, historical regression expected)

## Additional Metrics

### Target Quality & Efficiency

## Expert Rankings Deep Dive (Third Verification Pass)

This section addresses a critical question: **Does Strange's favorable schedule overcome his lower expert rankings?**

### Week 13 Expert Consensus Rankings (VERIFIED)

| Source | Goedert | Gadsden | Strange | Waller |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| NBC Sports | TE13 | **TE6** | TE16 | Not ranked |
| Pro Football Network | TE10 | **TE3** | TE14 | Not ranked |
| ClutchPoints | **TE6** | TE8 | TE13 | Not ranked |
| CBS Sports (varies) | TE8-10 | TE6-8 | TE6-13 | Not ranked |
| FantasyPros (half-PPR) | TE7-8 | **TE5-6** | TE8-13 | Not ranked |

**Key Finding:** Expert consensus heavily favors **Gadsden > Goedert > Strange** for Week 13.

### Rest of Season (ROS) Expert Rankings (VERIFIED - Pro Football Network)

| Player | ROS TE Rank | Overall Rank | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| **Gadsden** | **TE5** | 66 | Highest ranked of the four |
| **Goedert** | TE11 | 109 | Mid-tier TE1 |
| **Strange** | Not listed | — | Below TE20 in ROS rankings |
| **Waller** | TE31 | 277 | Bottom of rankings |

### Why Experts Rank Strange Lower

1. **Volume Concerns (VERIFIED)**
   - 5 or fewer targets in 3 of 5 healthy games
   - Pre-injury: just 4.0 catches, 40.8 yards/game
   - Week 12 return: 5 targets (led team, but low volume)

2. **Zero Touchdowns**
   - 0 TDs in 6 games played
   - Goedert: 7 TDs (TE leader)
   - Waller: 4 TDs in 4 games
   - Gadsden: 2 TDs

3. **Quarterback Situation**
   - Mac Jones starting for JAX (limited ceiling)
   - Compare: Herbert (LAC), Hurts (PHI), Tua (MIA)
   - Jaguars have 2nd-worst passing offense

4. **Target Competition**
   - Brian Thomas Jr. returning from injury
   - Jakobi Meyers acquired at deadline
   - Parker Washington emerging

### Why Experts May Be WRONG About Strange for Playoffs

1. **Schedule Blindness**
   - ROS rankings don't fully weight playoff matchup quality
   - Strange faces IND twice (5th-most to TEs) and NYJ
   - Gadsden faces PHI (3rd-best) and KC in crucial weeks
   - Goedert faces LV (4th-best) and BUF (#1 vs TEs)

2. **Week 12 Sample Size**
   - Strange's 93-yard return was impressive
   - 71.4% route share, 89.6% snap share
   - Led team in receiving
   - Experts haven't fully priced in the return

3. **Evan Engram's Absence**
   - Engram released (102 targets/year historically)
   - Strange is clear TE1 now
   - Target share should increase

4. **Travis Hunter OUT for Season**
   - LCL surgery, done for year
   - Removes target competition
   - Strange's ceiling higher than experts project

### Expert Rankings vs Schedule Reality

| Player | Expert ROS Rank | Playoff Schedule | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Gadsden | **TE5** (best) | PHI + KC Weeks 14-15 (**brutal**) | DROP despite ranking |
| Goedert | TE11 | LV + BUF Week 15 & 17 (**brutal**) | DROP despite TDs |
| Strange | ~TE18+ (worst) | IND + NYJ + IND (**elite**) | KEEP despite ranking |
| Waller | TE31 | NYJ + CIN + TB (**elite**) | KEEP despite ranking |

### The Ranking-Schedule Paradox

**Expert rankings reflect season-long production, not playoff optimization.**

- Gadsden is ranked TE5 ROS because of his 507 yards and consistent targets
- But Week 14 vs PHI (only 1 TD allowed to TEs) and Week 15 @ KC are terrible spots
- Strange is ranked ~TE18 because of 0 TDs and low volume
- But his Week 14 vs IND and Week 15 vs NYJ matchups are among the best available

**For playoff success, schedule matters more than season-long ranking.**

### Final Expert Ranking Reconciliation

| Factor | Favors Gadsden/Goedert | Favors Strange/Waller |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Season production | ✅ Higher yards, TDs | ❌ |
| Expert consensus | ✅ Higher ranked | ❌ |
| Playoff schedule | ❌ Brutal matchups | ✅ Elite matchups |
| Week 15 (must-win) | ❌ KC, LV | ✅ NYJ, PIT |
| Week 17 (championship) | ❌ BUF, HOU | ✅ IND, TB |
| Upside when it matters | ❌ | ✅ |

**Conclusion:** Expert rankings would suggest keeping Gadsden (TE5) over Strange (~TE18). However, for a **4th seed with no bye week**, playoff schedule optimization is more important than ROS rankings. Strange's elite matchups (IND twice, NYJ) outweigh his lower expert ranking for your specific playoff situation.

## Projected Points Analysis (Fourth Verification Pass)

This section incorporates expert projections to balance against schedule analysis.

### Week 13 Projected Points (VERIFIED)

| Player | Proj Pts (PPR) | Proj Line | Opponent | Source |
|--------|---------------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Goedert** | **9.4** | 4 rec, 45 yds, 0.2 TD | vs CHI | Pro Football Network |
| **Gadsden** | **8-10** | ~3 rec, 40.5 yds | vs LV | Underdog/Consensus |
| **Strange** | **8-9** | 3-4 rec, ~40 yds | @ TEN | CBS/Consensus |
| **Waller** | N/A | Returning from IR | vs NO | — |

**Key Finding:** Projections for Week 13 are very similar (8-10 points) despite different rankings.

### Season Averages (PPR Points Per Game)

| Player | PPR PPG | Games | Total Pts | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Gadsden** | **10.9** | 9 | 98.1 | TE9 since Week 3 debut |
| **Strange** | **10.3** | 5 (full) | 51.5 | TE14 pace when healthy |
| **Goedert** | **9.8** | 8 | 78.4 | TE10 in PPG, TD-dependent |
| **Waller** | **12.3** | 4 | 49.2 | Small sample, 4 TDs |

### Rest of Season (ROS) Projected Total Points

| Player | ROS Proj Rank | Total Proj Pts | Weekly Avg | Source |
|--------|--------------|----------------|------------|--------|
| **Goedert** | TE4 | **83.1** | 16.6/wk | DraftSharks (older) |
| **Gadsden** | TE5-8 | **~55-60** | 11.0/wk | Estimated from PPG |
| **Strange** | TE12-15 | **~50-55** | 10.0/wk | Estimated from PPG |
| **Waller** | TE20+ | **~40-50** | 8-10/wk | Highly variable |

**Critical Caveat:** Goedert's 83.1 ROS projection was calculated earlier in the season when his TD pace was assumed sustainable. Multiple analysts now flag him as "the biggest TD regression candidate in the league."

### Projection vs Matchup Quality Matrix

| Week | Goedert | Gadsden | Strange | Waller |
|------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| **13** | 9.4 vs CHI (good) | 8-10 vs LV (bad) | 8-9 @ TEN (bad) | ? vs NO |
| **14** | ~10 @ LAC (avg) | ~6-8 vs PHI (**brutal**) | ~12-14 vs IND (**smash**) | ~10 @ NYJ (good) |
| **15** | ~7-9 vs LV (**tough**) | ~5-7 @ KC (**brutal**) | ~11-13 vs NYJ (**good**) | ~9-11 @ PIT (avg) |
| **16** | ~9-11 @ WSH (avg) | ~9-11 @ DAL (avg) | ~8-10 @ DEN (avg) | ~14-18 vs CIN (**SMASH**) |
| **17** | ~5-7 @ BUF (**brutal**) | ~8-10 vs HOU (avg) | ~12-14 @ IND (**smash**) | ~12-15 vs TB (**good**) |

### Cumulative Playoff Projections (Weeks 14-17)

| Player | W14 | W15 | W16 | W17 | **Total** | **Rank** |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----------|----------|
| **Goedert** | 10 | 8 | 10 | 6 | **34** | 4th |
| **Gadsden** | 7 | 6 | 10 | 9 | **32** | 5th |
| **Strange** | 13 | 12 | 9 | 13 | **47** | **1st** |
| **Waller** | 10 | 10 | 16 | 13 | **49** | **1st** |

*Note: These are rough estimates combining baseline projections with matchup adjustments.*

### The Projection Paradox

**ESPN/FantasyPros project Gadsden > Strange for Week 13** because:
- Gadsden has higher baseline production (10.9 PPG vs 10.3)
- Herbert > Mac Jones
- Chargers are a better passing offense

**But projections don't fully capture:**
1. **Matchup severity** - Raiders are 4th-best vs TEs; Titans 8th-fewest (both bad, but Week 14+ diverges)
2. **Playoff week variance** - Gadsden's PHI/KC weeks will crater his projections when those weeks arrive
3. **TD regression** - Goedert's projections still bake in TD expectation that may not materialize

### Revised Recommendation with Projections

| Metric | Favors Gadsden/Goedert | Favors Strange/Waller |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Week 13 projections | ✅ Slightly higher | ❌ |
| Weeks 14-15 projections | ❌ PHI/KC/LV tank value | ✅ IND/NYJ boost value |
| Weeks 16-17 projections | ❌ BUF devastates Goedert | ✅ CIN/TB/IND elite |
| **Cumulative playoff total** | ~32-34 points | **~47-49 points** |

### Bottom Line on Projections

**If you trust ESPN's Week 13 projections:** Start Gadsden (8-10) or Goedert (9.4) this week. They're slightly favored.

**If you're optimizing for Weeks 14-17:** Strange + Waller project for **~47-49 combined playoff points** vs Gadsden + Goedert's **~32-34 points**. That's a **40-50% advantage** during the playoffs.

**The tradeoff is clear:**
- Gadsden/Goedert = marginally better Week 13, significantly worse Weeks 14-17
- Strange/Waller = marginally worse Week 13, significantly better Weeks 14-17

For a 4th seed who must win Weeks 15-17, the playoff projections matter more.

## Optimal Starter by Week

| Week | Recommended Starter | Backup Option | Reasoning |
|------|---------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **14** | **Strange vs IND** | Waller @ NYJ | Colts allow 5th-most to TEs, home game |
| **15** | **Strange vs NYJ** | Waller @ PIT | Must-win week - need floor vs leaky Jets at home |
| **16** | **Waller vs CIN** | Strange @ DEN | Bengals 32nd vs TEs - smash spot, primetime |
| **17** | **Waller vs TB** | Strange @ IND | Both excellent; Waller home vs collapsing D |

---

## Final Recommendation

### Keep:
| Player | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Waller** | Primary starter Weeks 16-17, elite RZ upside, best matchups |
| **Strange** | Primary starter Weeks 14-15, high floor, excellent schedule |

### Drop:
| Player | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|
| **Goedert** | TD-dependent, brutal playoff matchups (LV 4th-best, BUF #1 vs TEs), low yardage floor |
| **Gadsden** | PHI Week 14 and KC Week 15 are brutal for must-win games, recent slump |

### Why Waller + Strange:
1. **Best combined playoff schedule** - covers all weeks optimally
2. **Complementary strengths** - Strange's floor + Waller's TD ceiling
3. **Week 15 safety** - Strange vs NYJ at home is much safer than Goedert vs LV or Gadsden @ KC
4. **Week 17 insurance** - If Waller struggles, Strange @ IND is also a smash spot
5. **Home games when it matters** - Strange home Weeks 14-15, Waller home Weeks 16-17

### Counter-Arguments (For Transparency):

**Case for keeping Goedert:**
- 7 TDs leads ALL TEs (proven RZ production)
- Eagles' #1 red zone offense (75-78%) supports continued TDs
- Perfect 7/7 on RZ targets
- More proven track record than Strange
- Week 13 vs CHI is favorable (8th-most to TEs)

**Case for keeping Gadsden:**
- Higher yardage floor (56.3 YPG vs Strange's ~45)
- Herbert > any JAX QB
- Record-breaking rookie season
- Coming off bye week (rested)

**Why we still recommend Waller + Strange:**
- Playoff schedule trumps regular season production
- Goedert's Week 15 (LV) and Week 17 (BUF) matchups are brutal
- Gadsden's Week 14 (PHI) and Week 15 (KC) matchups are brutal
- As 4th seed, you can't afford bad matchups in must-win games
- Strange's Week 12 return (93 yards) shows he can produce
