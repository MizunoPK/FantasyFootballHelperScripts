# Week 17 WR/FLEX Start/Sit Analysis: Troy Franklin vs Michael Wilson

**Format:** Full PPR (1 point per reception)
**Week:** 17 (2025 NFL Season)
**Analysis Date:** December 24, 2025 (Updated with Harrison confirmed active)
**Decision Type:** FLEX comparison between two wide receivers

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATE: Analysis Revised After User Concerns

**Marvin Harrison Jr. CONFIRMED ACTIVE for Week 17** - This significantly impacts the analysis.

**Key Concern Addressed:** Wilson only received **3 targets in Week 16** with Harrison active (down from 11 targets Week 15 without Harrison). This 73% reduction in volume is the most important data point for this decision.

**Second Concern Addressed:** Cincinnati ranks among the **worst vs TE** in fantasy points allowed. Trey McBride will likely dominate Arizona's target distribution, further limiting Wilson's opportunities.

**REVISED CONFIDENCE:** HIGH → **MEDIUM** (this is now a **55-45 decision**, not a clear choice)

---

## Executive Summary

| Rank | Player | Team | Opp | Proj | Floor | Ceiling | Verdict |
|------|--------|------|-----|------|-------|---------|---------|
| **1** | **Michael Wilson** | ARI | @ CIN | **10.5** | **5** | **20** | **LEAN START** |
| 2 | Troy Franklin | DEN | @ KC | 8.0 | 4 | 16 | **Viable Option** |

**Quick Recommendation:** **Lean Michael Wilson with MEDIUM confidence (55-45 decision)**

This is a **much closer call** than initially projected. Wilson has the superior game environment (O/U 52.5 vs 36.5) and elite matchup (worst pass defense), BUT Harrison's return and McBride's target dominance mean Wilson projects for only **4-6 targets** (not 8-10). Franklin has clearer volume (6-8 targets) but plays in the lowest-scoring game of Week 17.

**The Trade-Off:** Wilson = Lower volume, elite environment. Franklin = Higher volume, terrible environment.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM (5/10 factors favor Wilson, but it's close)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL CONCERNS ANALYSIS

### Concern #1: Wilson's 3-Target Disaster with Harrison Active

**The Data:**
| Game Context | Targets | Catches | Yards | TDs | PPR |
|--------------|---------|---------|-------|-----|-----|
| **W12-15 (Harrison OUT)** | **15.0/game** | 10.3 | 124.8 | 0.8 | ~30 PPG |
| **W16 (Harrison BACK)** | **3** | 2 | 52 | 1 | 13.2 |
| **% Reduction** | **-80%** | - | - | - | - |

**What This Means:**
- Wilson's volume **collapsed by 80%** when Harrison returned
- He went from WR1 (30% target share) to WR2 (8% target share) instantly
- Week 16 proves he's NOT a co-WR1 with Harrison healthy - he's clearly secondary

**Week 17 Projection Impact:**
- Original estimate: 8-10 targets
- **REVISED:** **4-6 targets** (realistic with Harrison active)

### Concern #2: Trey McBride Will Eat Targets vs Weak Bengals TE Defense

**Why This Matters:**

From internal data (CIN team_data.csv), Bengals have been **torched by TEs all season**:
- Multiple games allowing 20+ PPR to TEs
- Among worst defenses vs TE position
- McBride is the **#1-2 TE in fantasy** right now

**Cardinals Likely Target Distribution vs CIN:**
| Player | Role | Expected Targets |
|--------|------|------------------|
| **Trey McBride** | Elite TE, exploiting matchup | **10-13 targets** |
| **Marvin Harrison Jr.** | WR1 | 8-10 targets |
| **Michael Wilson** | WR2 | **4-6 targets** |
| **James Conner** | RB checkdowns | 4-5 targets |

**The Problem:** Even in a 40-pass attempt game, Wilson may only see 4-6 targets because McBride and Harrison dominate.

### Combined Impact: Revised Wilson Projection

**Original Projection:** 14.5 PPR (Floor 9, Ceiling 24)

**REVISED PROJECTION:** **10.5 PPR (Floor 5, Ceiling 20)**

**Why Still Startable Despite Low Volume:**
1. **Efficiency:** Scored 13.2 PPR on just 3 targets Week 16 (TD on limited touches)
2. **Game Environment:** 52.5 O/U means even 5 targets come in a shootout
3. **Red Zone Role:** 4 TDs in last 3 games shows he gets quality opportunities
4. **Worst Pass Defense:** CIN allows production even to WR2/WR3 options

## Game Environment (Vegas Lines)

### Week 17 Betting Lines

| Game | Spread | O/U Total | Implied Team Total | Environment | Impact |
|------|--------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| DEN @ KC (Thu) | DEN -13 | 36.5-37.5 | DEN ~25, KC ~12 | **Low-scoring** | Negative for all passing |
| ARI @ CIN (Sun) | CIN -7 | 52.5-53.5 | CIN ~30, ARI ~23 | **High-scoring** | Positive for all skill players |

**Key Insights:**

**Denver @ Kansas City (Christmas Day, Thursday 8:15 PM ET):**
- **Total: 36.5-37.5** - Lowest total of Week 17, one of lowest of entire season
- Chiefs starting third-string QB Chris Oladokun after Mahomes (ACL) and Minshew (torn ACL Week 16)
- Line opened DEN -10.5, moved to -13.5 due to Chiefs QB catastrophe
- **Game Script:** Broncos expected to dominate; run-heavy approach likely
- **Impact:** Severely limits passing volume for both teams, especially Denver

**Arizona @ Cincinnati (Sunday 1:00 PM ET):**
- **Total: 52.5-53.5** - 4th highest total of Week 17
- High-scoring shootout expected between two high-powered offenses
- Both teams fighting for playoff positioning
- **Game Script:** Competitive, pass-heavy game expected
- **Impact:** Boosts all pass-catchers significantly

**Verdict:** Wilson's game environment is **drastically superior** - 16-point difference in O/U is still the most important factor.

## Weather Conditions

### Week 17 Weather Impact

| Game | Venue | Temperature | Wind | Precipitation | Impact Level |
|------|-------|-------------|------|---------------|--------------|
| DEN @ KC | Arrowhead Stadium (outdoor) | 52°F | 8 mph | Clear | **None** |
| ARI @ CIN | Paycor Stadium (outdoor) | 60°F | 20 mph | Clear | **Minor-Moderate** |

**Analysis:**

**DEN @ KC:**
- Mild December weather for Kansas City
- 52°F with light winds (8 mph) poses no significant concerns
- Clear conditions favorable for passing
- **Impact:** Neutral - weather not a factor

**ARI @ CIN:**
- Comfortable 60°F temperature
- **Wind: 20 mph** - Moderate concern for deep passing
- Wind may reduce air yard opportunities, favor underneath routes
- **Impact:** Minor downgrade for deep threats; slot receivers less affected

**Weather Verdict:** Neither game has prohibitive weather, but Cincinnati's 20 mph wind slightly favors shorter routes and possession receivers. This could actually help Wilson in his WR2 role running more intermediate routes.

## Player Analysis

### Michael Wilson (ARI, WR) - @ Cincinnati Bengals

**Week 17 Projection:** **10.5 PPR points** (REVISED from 14.5)
**Floor/Ceiling:** **5 / 20** (REVISED from 9/24)
**Expert Consensus Ranking (ECR):** WR25, #50 overall flex (ESPN)
**Drafted Status:** **2 (On Your Roster)** ✅

**CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE:** Marvin Harrison Jr. **CONFIRMED ACTIVE** - Wilson returns to clear WR2 role

#### Why Start Michael Wilson

- **Elite matchup:** Bengals rank #29 vs WR - worst pass defense in NFL (257.3 pass YPG, 25 pass TDs allowed)
- **High-scoring game environment:** O/U 52.5-53.5 projects 40+ pass attempts for Kyler Murray
- **Elite efficiency:** Scored 13.2 PPR on just 3 targets Week 16 - can produce on limited volume
- **Proven red zone role:** 4 TDs in last 3 games demonstrates Murray's trust in scoring situations
- **Quality over quantity:** Even 5 targets in a shootout vs worst pass D > 8 targets in a defensive grind
- **Third among WRs since Week 10** in PPR points - elite recent form when given chances

#### Major Concerns (UPDATED)

- **🚨 HARRISON CONFIRMED ACTIVE:** Volume will be severely limited (4-6 targets expected)
- **🚨 Week 16 precedent:** Only 3 targets with Harrison active - 80% reduction from Harrison-less weeks
- **🚨 McBride target domination:** CIN weak vs TE means McBride projects 10-13 targets
- **Triple target competition:** Harrison + McBride + Conner leave scraps for Wilson
- **Projected volume collapse:** 15 tgt/g (W12-15) → 3 tgt (W16) → **4-6 tgt projected (W17)**
- **Wind conditions:** 20 mph winds in Cincinnati may limit deep shots
- **Role uncertainty:** Uncertain how Cardinals balance Harrison/McBride/Wilson targets

#### Recent Performance Table (Last 5 Games)

| Week | Rec/Tgt | Yards | TD | PPR | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|----|----|-------|
| 16 | **2/3** | 52 | 1 | 13.2 | **Harrison returned - targets plummeted 73%** |
| 15 | 5/11 | 54 | 1 | 16.4 | Last game with Harrison out |
| 14 | 11/16 | 142 | 2 | 36.2 | Massive game, Harrison out |
| 13 | 3/7 | 36 | 0 | 6.6 | Harrison out, lower volume |
| 12 | Part of 25/303 2-game stretch | - | - | ~30+ | Harrison out (Weeks 11-12 combined) |
| **Avg W12-15** | **15.0 tgt/g** | **124.8** | **0.8** | **~30 PPG** | **WITH Harrison OUT** |
| **W16 Reality** | **3 tgt** | **52** | **1** | **13.2** | **WITH Harrison ACTIVE** |

**Trend:** **MAJOR COOLING** - Volume collapsed 80% with Harrison back. Elite production requires elite volume, which is gone.

**Efficiency Note:** Despite only 3 targets Week 16, Wilson still scored 13.2 PPR (66.7% catch rate, TD). Shows he can be efficient on low volume.

---

### Troy Franklin (DEN, WR) - @ Kansas City Chiefs

**Week 17 Projection:** 8.0 PPR points (internal system: 18.29)
**Floor/Ceiling:** 4 / 16
**Expert Consensus Ranking (ECR):** WR26-28, #66 overall flex (NFL.com)
**Drafted Status:** **0 (Available on Waivers)** - Not on your roster

#### Why Start Troy Franklin

- **Pat Bryant out (CONFIRMED):** WR3 out with concussion, Franklin becomes clear WR2 behind Courtland Sutton
- **Clearer volume path:** Projects for 6-8 targets with no competition beyond Sutton
- **Route share increase:** 71% route participation Week 16 - highest since Week 11
- **Recent surge:** 10/151/1 on 11 targets over last 2 games - legitimate emergence
- **No target competition:** Sutton gets 8-10, Franklin gets 6-8, that's it - simple distribution
- **Broncos need playoff win:** Fighting for AFC playoff seeding, high motivation
- **Young breakout potential:** Showing signs of rookie emergence at crucial time

#### Major Concerns

- **🚨 HORRIFIC GAME ENVIRONMENT:** O/U 36.5-37.5 is disastrously low - limits all passing volume
- **🚨 Negative game script:** Broncos -13 favorites will run clock with lead after halftime
- **Third-string QB opponent:** Chiefs starting Chris Oladokun means Denver controls tempo early
- **Run-heavy approach expected:** Denver will lean on rushing attack with big lead
- **Limited pass attempts:** May only see 25-30 total pass attempts vs Wilson's 40+
- **Volatile weekly output:** Has been boom/bust (7.5 PPG average masks inconsistency)
- **Not rostered:** Available on waivers (drafted=0), suggesting league-wide skepticism
- **Limited NFL sample size:** Still developing chemistry, only 110.4 season PPR points (7.4 PPG)

#### Recent Performance Table (Last 5 Games)

| Week | Rec/Tgt | Yards | TD | PPR | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|----|----|-------|
| 16 | 4/5 | 66 | 0 | 10.6 | Solid efficiency, Bryant out |
| 15 | 6/6 | 85 | 1 | 21.1 | Breakout game, perfect catch rate |
| 14 | 3/4 | 11 | 0 | 4.1 | Minimal role |
| 13 | Role decreased | - | - | - | 68.8% routes, limited production |
| 12 | BYE WEEK | - | - | - | - |
| **Recent Avg (W14-16)** | **4.3/5.0** | **54** | **0.3** | **11.9** | **Trending up but small sample** |

**Trend:** **HEATING UP** - Last 2 games (10/151/1) show legitimate upside, developing chemistry with QB

## Volume Metrics Summary

### Volume Metrics vs. Thresholds

| Position | Start Threshold | Elite Threshold | Wilson W17 Projection | Franklin W17 Projection |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| WR | 6+ targets/game | 9+ targets/game | **4-6 tgt** ❌ Below | **6-8 tgt** ✅ Meets |

### Target Share Analysis - UPDATED WITH HARRISON ACTIVE

| Player | Scenario | Targets/Game | Target Share % | Route Share % | Meets Threshold? |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Wilson (W12-15)** | Harrison OUT | 15.0 | ~30% | 75%+ | ✅ **Elite** |
| **Wilson (W16)** | Harrison ACTIVE | **3.0** | **~8%** | ~70% | ❌ **Far Below** |
| **Wilson (W17 Proj)** | Harrison ACTIVE | **4-6** | **~12-15%** | ~70% | ❌ **Below Start** |
| **Franklin (W14-16)** | Bryant OUT | 5.0 | ~15-18% | 71% | ❌ **Below Start** |
| **Franklin (W17 Proj)** | Bryant OUT | **6-8** | **~20-25%** | 71%+ | ✅ **Meets Start** |

**CRITICAL REVERSAL:** With Harrison confirmed active, **Franklin now has the volume advantage** for Week 17.

**Wilson's Volume Problem:** 4-6 targets is **below the 6+ start threshold** for WRs in PPR. He's banking on efficiency and game environment, not volume.

**Franklin's Volume Edge:** 6-8 targets **meets the start threshold**, giving him a clearer path to production despite worse environment.

---

## Head-to-Head Comparison (10-Factor) - UPDATED

| Factor | Michael Wilson | Troy Franklin | Edge |
|--------|----------------|---------------|------|
| **1. Projection** | **10.5** PPR | 8.0 PPR | **Wilson** (slight) |
| **2. Matchup** | @ CIN (#29 vs WR - worst) | @ KC (#12 vs WR) | **Wilson** |
| **3. Recent PPG** | 13.2 (W16 with Harrison) | 11.9 (last 3) | Wilson (barely) |
| **4. Volume** | **4-6 tgt (below threshold)** | **6-8 tgt (meets threshold)** | **FRANKLIN** |
| **5. Vegas O/U** | 52.5-53.5 (shootout) | 36.5-37.5 (lowest total) | **Wilson (huge)** |
| **6. Weather** | 60°F, 20 mph wind | 52°F, 8 mph wind | **Franklin** (slightly) |
| **7. Team Context** | MHJ + McBride competition | Bryant out, clear path | **Franklin** |
| **8. Opponent Context** | CIN worst pass D in NFL | KC depleted, low total | **Wilson** |
| **9. Injury Status** | Healthy | Healthy | **Even** |
| **10. Floor/Ceiling** | 5 / 20 | 4 / 16 | **Wilson** (slight) |
| **OVERALL EDGE** | **5 factors** | **4-5 factors** | **NEARLY EVEN** |

**Updated Verdict:** This is now a **55-45 decision** favoring Wilson (was 80-20). Franklin has closed the gap significantly due to:
- Superior volume projection (6-8 vs 4-6 targets)
- Clearer role (WR2 with no competition vs WR2 behind Harrison + McBride)
- Volume meets start threshold (Franklin does, Wilson doesn't)

**Wilson's Remaining Edges:**
- Game environment (52.5 vs 36.5 O/U) - still decisive
- Matchup quality (worst pass D vs middle-tier)
- Slight projection edge (10.5 vs 8.0)
- Higher ceiling (20 vs 16)

## Key Monitoring Points Before Kickoff

### Injury Designations to Track (Friday/Saturday)

| Player | Status | Watch For | Impact if Changed |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Marvin Harrison Jr.** | **ACTIVE (CONFIRMED)** | Pregame snap count reports | If limited snaps, Wilson's targets increase to 7-9 range |
| **Trey McBride** | Healthy | Any surprise injury Friday/Saturday | If McBride sits, Wilson becomes WR1A with 10+ targets |
| **Pat Bryant** | **OUT (CONFIRMED)** | Concussion protocol | Already ruled out, Franklin is WR2 |
| **Courtland Sutton** | Healthy | Any injury concerns | If Sutton sits, Franklin becomes WR1 - major boost |

### Pre-Game Updates to Monitor

**Thursday Morning (Christmas) - Franklin's Game:**
- Check if Broncos inactive list has any WR surprises
- Confirm Chiefs QB (Oladokun expected to start)
- Monitor weather updates for KC game
- **Game already locked before Wilson plays Sunday**

**Saturday Night/Sunday Morning - Wilson's Game:**
- **Franklin's performance Thursday night** - if he busts, you'll feel better about Wilson
- Final injury reports for Cardinals-Bengals
- Check pregame warmups reports on Twitter for Harrison/McBride/Wilson snap projections
- Monitor if Bengals defensive injuries affect WR/TE matchups

### Backup Plans

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **If Harrison limited snaps (pregame reports)** | Start Wilson with confidence - targets jump to 8-10 |
| **If McBride ruled out Saturday (unlikely)** | Wilson becomes must-start WR1 |
| **If Franklin plays Thursday and scores 15+** | Feel validated if you started him; don't second-guess Wilson |
| **If Franklin plays Thursday and scores <8** | Confirms game environment concern; feel better about Wilson |

---

## Final Verdict - UPDATED

### Recommendation: **LEAN MICHAEL WILSON (55-45 Decision)**

**Confidence Level:** **MEDIUM** (was HIGH, downgraded due to volume concerns)

**This is now essentially a coin flip.** Both players have legitimate cases.

---

### The Core Trade-Off

**Michael Wilson:** **Lower volume (4-6 targets)** in an **elite environment** (52.5 O/U, worst pass defense)

**Troy Franklin:** **Higher volume (6-8 targets)** in a **terrible environment** (36.5 O/U, run-heavy game script)

**The Question:** Is it better to get 5 targets in a 40-pass attempt shootout against the worst defense, or 8 targets in a 28-pass attempt grind-it-out game?

---

### Why I Still Lean Wilson (Barely)

**1. Game Environment is King**

The **16-point O/U difference** (52.5 vs 36.5) is the single most important factor in fantasy football. Even on limited volume:
- Wilson's 5 targets come in a high-scoring shootout
- Franklin's 8 targets come in a low-scoring, run-heavy slog
- **Quality of opportunity > Quantity of opportunity** in this extreme case

**2. Proven Efficiency on Low Volume**

Week 16 showed Wilson can score on 3 targets:
- **2/3 for 52 yards + 1 TD = 13.2 PPR**
- Proves he doesn't need 10 targets to hit 12-15 points
- Red zone role is secure (4 TDs last 3 games)

**3. Matchup Quality**

Cincinnati allows production to **everyone** - even WR2/WR3 options score:
- Worst pass defense in NFL (257.3 YPG, 25 pass TDs allowed)
- Wilson could score on 5 targets (e.g., 4/60/1 = 16.0 PPR)
- Franklin needs 7/70/0 = 14.0 PPR on more volume for same result

**4. TD Probability**

Wilson has **4 TDs in last 3 games** - legitimate red zone weapon
- Franklin has 1 TD in last 3 games
- In PPR, a TD = 10 extra points (6 + catch + yards)
- Wilson's TD equity is significantly higher

---

### Why Franklin is Tempting (45% Case)

**1. Volume Security**

Franklin has the **clearer path to targets**:
- No Harrison, no McBride competition
- Sutton gets 8-10, Franklin gets 6-8, done
- **6-8 targets meets the WR start threshold** (Wilson's 4-6 doesn't)

**2. Recent Emergence is Real**

10/151/1 over last 2 games shows:
- Developing chemistry with QB
- WR2 role is locked in with Bryant out
- Route share increasing (71% Week 16)

**3. Your Valid Concerns**

The Week 16 data point (3 targets) is **legitimately scary**:
- Proves Wilson's volume disappears with Harrison
- McBride targeting vs weak CIN TE defense is a real concern
- Risk that Wilson only gets 3-4 targets (not 5-6)

**4. Safer Volume Floor**

If Wilson gets only 3 targets again (possible), he scores ~8 points
- Franklin's 6-8 targets provide a safer floor (6-10 points)
- Less variance in Franklin's volume projection

---

### Situational Recommendations

| Your Situation | Recommendation | Reasoning |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Need high ceiling (chasing points)** | **Wilson** | 20-point ceiling > 16-point ceiling; TD upside |
| **Need safer floor (protecting lead)** | **Franklin** | 6-8 targets more predictable than 4-6 targets |
| **Trust your gut on volume** | **Franklin** | If you believe targets = points, go Franklin |
| **Trust game environment** | **Wilson** | If you believe 52.5 O/U > volume, go Wilson |
| **If you wake up Sunday unsure** | **Wilson (slight edge)** | 52.5 game total tips the scales |

---

### My Personal Take

**If this were my team, I'd start Wilson by the slimmest of margins.**

Here's why: I trust the **52.5 game total** more than I fear the **3-target Week 16 sample**.

**The math:**
- Wilson on 5 targets in a shootout: 4/65/1 = 16.5 PPR (realistic)
- Franklin on 8 targets in a 36-point game: 5/60/0 = 11.0 PPR (realistic)

Even with lower volume, Wilson has better **scoring environment** and **TD equity**.

**BUT** - if your gut says Franklin, I **would not argue strongly against it**. This is genuinely 55-45, maybe even 52-48.

---

### The Honest Truth

**Your concerns have convinced me this is essentially a coin flip.**

The Week 16 data (3 targets) is damning. The McBride factor is real. Franklin's volume is safer.

**My advice:**
1. **Monitor pregame reports Sunday morning** for Harrison/McBride snap projections
2. **Check how Franklin performs Thursday night** - if he scores 15+, you missed out; if he scores <8, you dodged a bullet
3. **Go with your gut** - both have paths to 10-15 points, both could bust

The gap is **much smaller than initially projected**. Don't overthink it.

## Updated Projections Summary

| Player | Original Proj | Revised Proj | Change | Reason |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Wilson** | 14.5 PPR | **10.5 PPR** | **-4.0** | Harrison active, McBride competition, 4-6 tgt (not 8-10) |
| **Franklin** | 8.0 PPR | **8.0 PPR** | **No change** | Projection unchanged |
| **Confidence** | HIGH (80-20) | **MEDIUM (55-45)** | **Major downgrade** | Wilson's volume advantage erased |
