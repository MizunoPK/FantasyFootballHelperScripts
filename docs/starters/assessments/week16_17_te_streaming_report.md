## ⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATE: December 15, 2025

### Patrick Mahomes ACL Tear - Chiefs Eliminated

**Breaking News:** Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL on December 14, 2025 against the Chargers. The Chiefs (6-8) have been eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in 11 seasons. Gardner Minshew will start the remaining games.

**Impact on TE Streaming:**
- **Gunnar Helm (TEN) vs KC Week 16:** Previously listed as "avoid" due to KC's strong TE defense. This matchup is now UPGRADED - KC defense may be demoralized and facing more snaps with a struggling offense.
- **Any TE vs KC:** Consider as streamable options going forward.

### Elijah Arroyo (SEA) Placed on IR

Arroyo was placed on **Injured Reserve** after his Week 14 knee injury. He is OUT for the remainder of the regular season (minimum 4 games). Earliest possible return: playoffs.

**Impact:** AJ Barner's value significantly UPGRADED for Weeks 16 & 17 with no TE competition.

### Davante Adams (LAR) Likely OUT Week 16

Adams suffered a hamstring injury in Week 15 vs Lions (same hamstring that had him questionable entering the game). With a **Thursday Night game** vs Seattle, he is **unlikely to play Week 16**.

**Impact:** Colby Parkinson's target share could increase significantly. Parkinson already has **6 TDs in his last 6 games** and is the clear red zone option.

**Per the research guide, TEs need 5+ targets/game for "Start Threshold" and 7+ for "Elite Threshold".**

| Player | Targets/Game | Threshold Met? |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Loveland | 4.6 | ❌ Below (close) |
| Strange | 4.5 | ❌ Below (close) |
| Parkinson | 4.2 | ❌ Below |
| Barner | 3.8 | ❌ Below |

**Important Context:** None of these streaming options meet the 5+ target threshold. This is typical for waiver-wire TEs—elite target volume is monopolized by rostered studs (Kelce, Andrews, etc.). For streamers, we compensate with:
- **Matchup advantage** (facing weak TE defenses)
- **Red zone efficiency** (Parkinson's 9/10 conversion rate)
- **Role expansion** (Barner post-Arroyo injury)
- **Route participation** (Parkinson's 71% is elite for a TE)

This is why matchup and efficiency matter more for streaming TEs than for locked-in starters.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Scenario-Based Guidance

| Your Situation | Week 16 Start | Week 17 Start |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Best available on waivers** | Darren Waller (vs CIN) | AJ Barner (@ CAR) |
| **Waller unavailable** | Colby Parkinson (@ SEA) | AJ Barner (@ CAR) |
| **You have Isaiah Likely (drafted=2)** | ⚠️ Risky - consider Parkinson | Brenton Strange or Parkinson |
| **Need ceiling (chasing points)** | Colston Loveland or Likely (risky) | Colston Loveland (@ SF) |
| **Need floor (protecting lead)** | Parkinson or Theo Johnson | Brenton Strange or Waller |
| **One pickup for both weeks** | **Colby Parkinson** | **Colby Parkinson** |
| **Parkinson unavailable** | **Brenton Strange** | **Brenton Strange** |

### Single Pickup Strategy

If you can only add ONE tight end for the playoff stretch:

**Recommended: Colby Parkinson (LAR)**

| Week | Opponent | Projection | Matchup | Assessment |
|------|----------|------------|---------|------------|
| 16 | @ SEA | 8.43 | B | Solid |
| 17 | @ ATL | 9.07 | B | Solid |

**Why Parkinson:**
- Consistent B-grade matchups both weeks
- **Hottest TE in football (6 TDs in last 6 games!)** - Updated Dec 15
- Week 15: 5 catches, 75 yards, 2 TDs = 24.5 PPR points (TE5 on week)
- Elite red zone efficiency (9/10 targets converted)
- 71% route share - no competition for targets
- Tyler Higbee on IR - role is locked
- **Davante Adams likely OUT Week 16** - more targets for Parkinson
- Rams (11-3) clinched playoffs - offense clicking

### Two-Pickup Strategy (Week-by-Week Streaming)

| Week | Primary | Backup |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Week 16** | Darren Waller (vs CIN) | Colby Parkinson (@ SEA) |
| **Week 17** | AJ Barner (@ CAR) | Brenton Strange (@ IND) |

---

## Matchups to Avoid

| Week | Player | Opponent | Why Avoid |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|
| 16 | Dalton Schultz | vs LV | Raiders #27 vs TE (7.0 PPG allowed) |
| 16 | Colston Loveland | vs GB | Packers #22 vs TE (below average) |
| 17 | Theo Johnson | @ LV | Raiders #27 vs TE (very tough) |
| 17 | Oronde Gadsden II | vs HOU | Texans #27 vs TE (7.4 PPG allowed) |
| 17 | Colston Loveland | @ SF | 49ers are top-10 defense |
| 16 | Mike Gesicki | @ MIA | Wrong side of CIN matchup |
| Both | Any TE vs BUF/PHI | - | Top-2 TE defenses |

### ~~Why Gunnar Helm Isn't Ranked Higher~~ UPDATED: Gunnar Helm Now Streamable

**Previous Assessment (Pre-Mahomes Injury):** Helm was avoided due to KC's elite TE defense.

**NEW Assessment (Post-Mahomes ACL):** With Mahomes out and KC eliminated from playoffs, the Chiefs defense is in a different situation. Helm (7.53 W16 projection) is now a **viable streaming option** in Week 16.

- **Week 16 vs KC:** UPGRADED - Chiefs defense may be demoralized; Gardner Minshew offense will struggle, putting defense on field more
- **Week 17 vs NO:** Neutral matchup (6.88 projection)
- Helm has emerged as Tennessee's TE1 (displaced Chig Okonkwo)

---

## Players Injured / Not Available ⬆️ UPDATED Dec 15

| Player | Team | Status | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| Davante Adams | LAR | **Hamstring** | Likely OUT Week 16 (Thursday game); boosts Parkinson |
| Elijah Arroyo | SEA | **IR (Knee)** | Out for rest of regular season; boosts Barner significantly |
| Evan Engram | JAX | **IR (Shoulder)** | Out for season; Brenton Strange now clear TE1 |
| Gunnar Helm | TEN | **TOE (Questionable)** | Injured Week 15 vs SF; monitor Friday practice |
| Cade Otton | TB | OUT (Knee) | Ruled out Week 16; would've had elite CAR matchup |
| Tyler Higbee | LAR | IR (Ankle) | Out since Week 11; opens path for Parkinson |
| Patrick Mahomes | KC | **IR (ACL)** | Out for season; impacts KC defense morale |

**Note:** Theo Johnson (NYG) was previously on IR (2024 foot injury) but is ACTIVE for 2025. He dealt with a minor toe injury in Week 14 but was cleared and led NYG in receiving Week 15.

## Key Monitoring Points Before Kickoff

### Week 16 Watch List ⬆️ UPDATED Dec 15

| Player | Watch For | Impact if Changed |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Darren Waller** | **Snap count vs PIT (TONIGHT!)** | If 60%+ snaps, confidence increases for Week 16 |
| **Isaiah Likely** | Mark Andrews target share | Andrews dominated Week 15 (0 tgt for Likely); monitor |
| **Colby Parkinson** | Matthew Stafford health | Any QB limitation affects all pass catchers |
| **Brenton Strange** | **Build on 11/73 career high** | Clear TE1 role with Engram out for season |
| **Gunnar Helm** | **TOE INJURY (Questionable)** | If limited/out, avoid Week 16 despite good matchup |

### Week 17 Watch List

| Player | Watch For | Impact if Changed |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **AJ Barner** | ~~Arroyo's status~~ **RESOLVED** | Arroyo on IR - Barner is locked in as sole TE |
| **Brenton Strange** | Week 16 performance | Strong outing confirms post-IR trajectory |
| **Darren Waller** | Weeks 15-16 usage | If snap share rises to 60%+, upgrade to START |
| **Colston Loveland** | Cole Kmet snap split | If Loveland hits 80%+ route share, upside increases |

### Injury Designations to Track (Friday/Saturday)

| Player | Current Status | Key Date | Action |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------|
| Darren Waller | Active (post-IR) | Friday practice report | Monitor snap projection |
| Elijah Arroyo (SEA) | **IR (Knee)** | N/A - OUT for regular season | Barner is locked in |
| Cade Otton (TB) | OUT (Knee) | Week 17 return possible | Could affect Waller Week 17 matchup |
| Trevor Lawrence | Healthy | Saturday confirmation | Strange value tied to QB |
| Mark Andrews (BAL) | Glute (cleared W15) | Friday practice report | If limited, Likely upgraded |

### Backup Plans

| If This Happens... | Then Do This... |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Waller inactive Week 16 | Move Likely to #1, add Parkinson |
| Barner disappoints Week 16 | Pivot to Strange for Week 17 |
| Strange aggravates quad | Theo Johnson becomes Week 17 fallback |
| Loveland splits 50/50 with Kmet | Avoid in both weeks |

---

## Conclusion

### Week 16 Priority ⚠️ UPDATED Dec 15 Post-Week 15
1. **Darren Waller** - Elite matchup vs Cincinnati (MNF tonight will show his snap count)
2. **Colby Parkinson** - 6 TDs in 6 games, Adams likely OUT = more targets (TNF Dec 18)
3. **Dalton Schultz** - Week 15 breakout (17.6 PPR), favorable LV matchup
4. **Oronde Gadsden II** - 90.7 PFF Week 15; trending up despite boom/bust profile
5. **Brenton Strange** - 🔥 CAREER HIGH 11/73 Week 15; @ DEN is neutral matchup
6. ~~Isaiah Likely~~ **DOWNGRADED** - 0 targets Week 15; Mark Andrews dominated TE work

### Week 17 Priority ⬆️ UPDATED
1. **Brenton Strange** - 🔥 Clear TE1 role + elite matchup @ Indianapolis (Colts #27 vs TE)
2. **AJ Barner** - Elite matchup @ Carolina (Panthers #30 vs TE); sole TE with Arroyo on IR
3. **Colby Parkinson** - Consistent floor + TD upside @ Atlanta; 6 TDs in 6 games
4. **Darren Waller** - Underrated matchup vs Tampa Bay (TB #29 vs TE)

### Overall Best Pickup
**Colby Parkinson (LAR)** - Works for both weeks with solid matchups, elite recent production, and locked-in role.

**Alternative:** If Parkinson is unavailable, **Brenton Strange (JAX)** offers the best combination of matchup quality (IND is favorable Week 17) and volume. Theo Johnson has high projections but faces tougher matchups (LV #27 vs TE in Week 17).
