## Executive Summary

This report ranks the optimal kicker streaming options for fantasy playoff Weeks 16 and 17. Kicker success depends primarily on: (1) Vegas lines/implied totals, (2) venue/weather, (3) offensive efficiency, and (4) opponent defense quality.

### Quick Reference

| Week | #1 Stream | #2 Stream | #3 Stream |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Week 16** | Eddy Pineiro (SF @ IND) | Harrison Mevis (LAR @ SEA) | Andy Borregales (NE @ BAL) |
| **Week 17** | Harrison Mevis (LAR @ ATL) | Jake Elliott (PHI @ NYG) | Cam Little (JAX @ IND) |

**Key Insight:** Eddy Pineiro is top-ranked streaming option for Week 16 (Monday night dome game, high implied total). Harrison Mevis is best two-week option (solid Week 16 + elite dome Week 17).

---

## Key Factors for Kicker Success

### 1. Vegas Lines (Most Important)
- High implied team totals (24+) = more scoring opportunities
- High O/U totals (47+) = shootout potential
- Favorites score more than underdogs

### 2. Venue & Weather
- **Dome games** = No weather variables, consistent conditions
- **Cold** (<40°F) = Reduced accuracy on 45+ yard attempts
- **Wind** (15+ mph) = Avoid entirely

### 3. Offensive Efficiency
- **High red zone TD%** = More XPs, fewer FG attempts
- **Low red zone TD%** = More FG opportunities
- Better offenses = more scoring trips overall

### 4. Opponent Defense
- **Strong defenses** = Teams stall in red zone = More FGs
- **Weak defenses** = Easy TDs or quick punts

---

**3. Andy Borregales (NE @ BAL)**

**Game:** Sunday, December 21, 1:00 PM ET
**Venue:** M&T Bank Stadium (Outdoor, ~40°F)
**Vegas:** 44.0 O/U, BAL -7.5, Patriots implied ~18.3

**Why #3:**
- **Elite matchup:** Ravens allow 2nd-most fantasy points to kickers (2025)

---

**5. Cam Little (JAX @ DEN)**

**Game:** Sunday, December 21, 1:00 PM ET
**Venue:** Mile High Stadium (Outdoor, ~55°F)

- **Week 15:** Hot streak ended (only 5 pts)
- **Motivation unknown:** Playoff elimination overrides excellent matchup

**Verdict:** Too risky despite elite game environment

- Context: Chiefs defense forces FG attempts
- Concern: Low Tennessee implied total
- Availability: <5% rostered

**Note:** Will Reichard (MIN) and Ka'imi Fairbairn (HOU) would both be top-3 options but are drafted=1 (not available).

---

## Two-Week Strategy

### Best Two-Week Option

**Harrison Mevis (LAR)** ⭐

| Week | Opponent | Venue | Implied Total | Outlook |
|------|----------|-------|---------------|---------|
| 16 | @ SEA | Outdoor (~45°F) | ~23.0 | Solid matchup, 44.5 O/U |
| 17 | @ ATL | **Dome** | ~24.3 | Elite dome matchup |

**Why Mevis for Both Weeks:**
- Perfect accuracy (5/5 FG, 28/28 XP)
- Only 5% rostered (widely available)
- Solid Week 16 + elite Week 17
- Rams offense rolling (11-3)

**Alternative:** Add Eddy Pineiro for Week 16 (#1 option), then pivot to Mevis for Week 17

---

## Scenario-Based Recommendations

### If You Need Ceiling (Chasing Points)
- **Week 16:** Eddy Pineiro (SF @ IND) - Monday night dome game, 26.0 implied total, perfect accuracy
- **Week 17:** Jake Elliott (PHI @ NYG) - Highest implied total (25.8)

### If You Need Floor (Protecting Lead)
- **Week 16:** Harrison Mevis (LAR @ SEA) - Perfect accuracy, consistent
- **Week 17:** Harrison Mevis (LAR @ ATL) - Dome game, safe environment

### If You Prioritize Dome Games
- **Week 16:** Eddy Pineiro (SF @ IND) - Only top-tier dome option available
- **Week 17:** Harrison Mevis (LAR @ ATL) - Best available dome option

---

## Red Zone Efficiency Context

### Teams with High Red Zone TD% (More XPs, Fewer FGs)

| Team | RZ TD % | Kicker | Strategy |
|------|---------|--------|----------|
| PHI | **71%** (#1 NFL) | Jake Elliott | Strong XP volume |
| DET | 68% | Jake Bates | Not available (drafted=1) |
| SF | 66% | Eddy Pineiro | Balanced FG/XP mix |

### Teams with Low Red Zone TD% (More FG Opportunities)

| Team | RZ TD % | Kicker | Opportunity Level |
|------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| CLE | ~52% | Andre Szmyt | High FG volume |
| NYJ | ~54% | Nick Folk | High FG volume |
| CAR | ~56% | Ryan Fitzgerald | Moderate FG volume |

---

## Weather Conditions to Monitor

### Week 16 Cold/Windy Games

| Game | Temperature | Wind | Impact | Action |
|------|-------------|------|--------|--------|
| LAR @ SEA | ~43°F | **11-18 mph, gusts to 31** | Wind = concern | Mevis still playable but risky |
| JAX @ DEN | ~55°F | 5-10 mph | Mild conditions | No concern for Little |
| MIN @ CHI | ~35°F | **15+ mph** | Wind = major issue | **AVOID Cairo Santos** |
| NE @ BAL | ~40°F | 5-10 mph | Manageable | Proceed with Borregales |

**Rule:** Temps below 40°F reduce 45+ yard accuracy. Wind above 15 mph = avoid entirely. Gusts over 30 mph create accuracy concerns.

---

## Key Monitoring Points Before Kickoff

### Injury/Status Updates to Watch

| Player | Watch For | Impact if Changed |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Eddy Pineiro | Hamstring status | Returned Week 15, should be fine |
| Matt Prater (BUF) | Quad injury | OUT Week 16 (confirmed) |
| Harrison Mevis | Still Rams starter? | Joshua Karty was waived (no competition) |

### Vegas Line Movements

Monitor for significant line changes (3+ point O/U movement or spread flip) that could affect implied totals.

### Weather Updates

Check weather forecasts Saturday evening for Sunday games, especially:
- Wind speeds for outdoor games
- Temperature changes for cold-weather games
