## Detailed Player Analysis

---

## Aaron Jones (MIN RB) - Elite Matchup Play

### Why Jones Has the Edge

**Strengths:**
1. ✅ **Elite matchup** (Giants allow 5.6 YPC - WORST in NFL)
2. ✅ **Higher projection** (14.08 PPR vs 13.24)
3. ✅ **Pass-catching role** (51 rec in 2024, fixture in passing game)
4. ✅ **Complete back** (most complete RB on Vikings roster)
5. ✅ **Vikings offense clicking** (31+ points last 2 games)
6. ✅ **Career-high usage in 2024** (700 snaps, 306 touches)

**Weaknesses:**
- Jordan Mason cutting into work (14-15 touches vs 20+ earlier)
- Lower O/U (43.5 vs Hampton's 49.5)
- "RB43 on RB37 usage this month" (volume down)
- Mason "out-expected him two weeks back"

### Giants Matchup (ELITE)

**Giants Run Defense - WORST IN NFL:**
- Allow **5.6 yards per carry** (dead last in NFL)
- Giants 2-12 record (quit on season)
- Terrible run defense all season
- Multiple RBs have torched them

**Matchup Grade: A+** (Dream matchup for RBs)

**Recent Giants Performances:**
- Allow consistent 100+ yard rushing games
- Cannot stop the run at all
- Vikings should dominate on the ground

### Workload Situation (CONCERN)

**2024 Season (Full Workload):**
- Career-high 255 carries for 1,138 yards, 5 TDs
- 51 receptions for 408 yards, 2 TDs
- Career-high 700 snaps, 306 total touches

**2025 Season (Jordan Mason Threat):**
- Vikings traded for Jordan Mason (March 2025)
- Mason on $5.5M contract (significant investment)
- Jones: 14-15 touches recently (down from 20+)
- Mason: "Rotating in a lot more"
- Split snaps near goal line recently

**Current Usage:**
- "RB43 on RB37 usage this month"
- Touch totals of 14-15 so far this month
- Expected half-PPR points: 7.2-8.9 last 4 games
- Mason out-expected him 2 weeks ago

**HC Kevin O'Connell's Plan:**
- "Jones is the most complete back on the roster"
- Remains fixture in passing game
- But Mason will see "more work than Ty Chandler did"

### Game Environment

- **MIN -3** (moderate favorites)
- **O/U 43.5** (LOW total - concerning)
- **Implied Total: 23.25** (decent scoring expected)
- Vikings beat Cowboys 34-26 Week 15 (offense clicking)
- 31+ points last 2 games

**Game Script:**
- Vikings should win comfortably vs 2-12 Giants
- Positive game script = run-heavy 2nd half
- Jones should see 14-16 touches

### Expected Stat Line

**Base Case:** 15 carries, 80 yards, 3/25 receiving, 0.5 TD = 14.5 PPR

**Best Case:** 18 carries, 100 yards, 4/30 receiving, 1 TD = 21.0 PPR

**Worst Case (Mason vultures):** 12 carries, 55 yards, 2/15 receiving, 0 TD = 9.5 PPR

**Confidence Level: HIGH** - Elite matchup outweighs workload concerns

---

## Omarion Hampton (LAC RB) - High-Scoring Game Script

### Why Hampton is Close

**Strengths:**
1. ✅ **Highest game total** (O/U 49.5 = most scoring expected)
2. ✅ **Plays Saturday 4:00 PM ET** (see results before Sunday)
3. ✅ **More carries** than Vidal (15 vs 12 recently)
4. ✅ **Recent success** (31 touches, 132 yards, TD last 2 games)
5. ✅ **HC Jim Harbaugh commitment** ("snap count will increase")
6. ✅ **TD upside** (goal-line back)
7. ✅ **On your roster** (no FAAB needed)

**Weaknesses:**
- Kimani Vidal leads snaps (63% to 37%)
- Limited receiving role (21% route rate)
- Cowboys "shored up run defense"
- Lower projection (13.24 vs 14.08)

### Cowboys Matchup (DECENT)

**Cowboys Run Defense:**
- Allow 7th-most fantasy points to RBs
- Allow 4.5 yards per carry
- **Tied for 2nd in rushing TDs allowed**
- BUT: "Shored up run defense" recently

**Matchup Grade: B+** (good, not elite)

**Recent Improvement:**
- Cowboys improved vs run in recent weeks
- Still allow TDs (tied for 2nd-most)
- Exploitable but not as easy as Giants

### Workload Situation (SPLIT WITH VIDAL)

**Snap Share (CONCERNING):**
- **Kimani Vidal: 63% snaps**
- **Hampton: 37% snaps**
- Vidal also leads route rate (55% to 21%)

**Touch Share (ENCOURAGING):**
- **Hampton: 15 carries** (leads)
- Vidal: 12 carries
- Hampton gets goal-line work

**Recent Performance (Last 2 Games):**
- 31 touches for 132 scrimmage yards, 1 TD
- Week 15 @ KC: 15 carries, 61 yards, 1/4 receiving
- Week 14 vs PHI: 13 carries, 56 yards, 2/11 receiving + TD

**OC Greg Roman's Plan:**
- Split is "so fluid"
- "Always going to go with the hot hand"
- Unpredictable week-to-week

**HC Jim Harbaugh's Commitment:**
- "Snap count will increase" as Hampton gets healthier
- Hampton "more dynamic" than Vidal
- Returning from ankle fracture

### Game Environment (BEST OF THE 2)

- **DAL -2.5** (close game)
- **O/U 49.5** (HIGHEST scoring game - 6 points higher than Jones)
- **Implied Total: 23.5** (similar to Jones)
- Close game = RBs involved throughout

**Game Script:**
- Competitive game (DAL -2.5)
- No blowout expected
- RBs will be used all game
- TD opportunities in high-scoring affair

### Saturday Advantage

**Plays at 1:00 PM PT / 4:00 PM ET Saturday:**
- See Hampton's results BEFORE Jones plays Sunday 1:00 PM ET
- If Hampton succeeds → Great, you're set
- If Hampton busts → Can pivot to other options Sunday
- **Risk mitigation tool**

### Expected Stat Line

**Base Case:** 16 carries, 70 yards, 2/15 receiving, 0.75 TD = 13.5 PPR

**Best Case:** 18 carries, 90 yards, 3/20 receiving, 1 TD = 17.0 PPR

**Worst Case (Vidal game):** 12 carries, 50 yards, 1/8 receiving, 0 TD = 7.8 PPR

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH** - Good game environment but workload uncertainty

### 2. START: Omarion Hampton (LAC RB) - RB2/FLEX (Good)

**Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Why Start:**
- ✅ Highest O/U (49.5 - best scoring environment)

**VERDICT:** High-scoring game environment (O/U 49.5) and Saturday timing make Hampton a solid RB2/FLEX option, but Jones' elite matchup gives him the edge.

---

## My Recommendation: START AARON JONES (Slight Edge)

### Why Jones Gets the Nod

**1. Elite Matchup Trumps Everything**
- Giants allow 5.6 YPC (WORST in NFL)
- Jones should feast on terrible run defense
- Hampton faces improved Cowboys run D

**2. Higher Projection + Pass-Catching Role**
- Jones: 14.08 PPR (51 rec in 2024)
- Hampton: 13.24 PPR (limited receiving)
- PPR leagues favor pass-catching backs

**3. Higher Floor Despite Workload Concerns**
- Jones floor: 9.5 PPR (pass-game safety net)
- Hampton floor: 7.8 PPR (Vidal can take over)

**4. Vikings Offense Clicking**
- 31+ points last 2 games
- Offense found their groove
- Jones benefits from better offense

### When to Start Hampton Instead

**START Hampton IF:**
1. You need **ceiling** (high-scoring game, O/U 49.5)
2. You want **Saturday results** (see performance before Sunday)
3. You're **projected to lose** and need boom potential
4. You value **game environment** over matchup quality

**START Jones IF:**
1. You value **elite matchup** (Giants worst run D)
2. You want **higher projection** (14.08 PPR)
3. You prefer **pass-catching backs** (PPR safety)
4. You're **favored** and want safe floor

### Expected Outcome

**Most Likely Finish:**
1. **Jones:** 14.5 PPR (elite matchup realized)
2. **Hampton:** 13.5 PPR (good game, solid performance)

**Difference:** ~1 PPR (very close call)

---

## If You Can Start Both

**IDEAL SCENARIO: Start Both**

If you have RB1, RB2, and FLEX spots:
1. **Jones** in RB1 (elite matchup)
2. **Hampton** in RB2/FLEX (high O/U)
3. Both should deliver 13-15 PPR (combined 27-30 PPR)

**This is the safest approach if roster allows**

---

## Critical Monitoring

### Friday 4:00 PM ET - Injury Reports

- Monitor Aaron Jones shoulder (expected active)
- Monitor Omarion Hampton (expected active)
- Check for any late changes

### Saturday 4:00 PM ET - Hampton's Game

**IF starting Hampton:**
- Watch his performance vs Cowboys
- If succeeds (13+ PPR) → Great, you're set
- If busts (<8 PPR) → Confirms workload concerns

### Sunday Morning - Final Decisions

- Confirm Jones active (expected)
- Check for any late news on Jordan Mason usage

---

## Summary Table

| Player | Proj | Matchup | O/U | Workload | Receiving | Plays When | Recommend |
|--------|------|---------|-----|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Jones** | **14.08** | **A+** (NYG worst) | 43.5 | 14-15 touches | **A** (51 rec 2024) | Sun 1PM | **START (RB1/2)** |
| **Hampton** | 13.24 | B+ (DAL decent) | **49.5** | 15 carries | C- (21% routes) | **Sat 4PM** | **START (RB2/FLEX)** |

---

## The Verdict

**START: Aaron Jones** (MIN RB) - RB1/2

**Slight edge** over Hampton due to:
1. Elite matchup (Giants 5.6 YPC - worst in NFL)
2. Higher projection (14.08 vs 13.24 PPR)
3. Pass-catching role (51 rec in 2024 = PPR safety)
4. Vikings offense clicking (31+ pts last 2 games)

**But Hampton is close** with:
- Better game environment (O/U 49.5 vs 43.5)
- Saturday game (risk mitigation)
- Goal-line role (TD upside)

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Jones:** 15-80-0, 3/25 receiving = 14.5 PPR
- **Hampton:** 16-70-0, 2/15 receiving = 13.5 PPR

**Realistically: Start Jones if you can only pick one. Start both if roster allows.**
