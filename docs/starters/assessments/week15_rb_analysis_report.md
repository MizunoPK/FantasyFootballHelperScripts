- Favorable game script: Cowboys home favorites (73% win probability) on Sunday Night Football
- High floor: Averaged 13.3 PPR as RB20 floor over recent 5-game stretch

**Concerns:**

- Receiving floor: 17.4% target share since Week 9, 5+ targets in 5 consecutive games
- Eagles run D struggling: Since Week 10, allows 5th-most rushing YPG
- ESPN "Lineup Lock" designation despite efficiency limitations

**Concerns:**
- Brutal efficiency: Only 3.5 YPC and 4.4 yards per target

- O-line disaster: 0.72 inches before contact per carry (last 3 weeks)

**Recent Performance:**
| Week | Rush | Yards | YPC | Rec | Tgt | PPR |
|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 14 | 10 | 30 | 3.0 | 2 | 4 | 9.8 |

### 3. Omarion Hampton (LAC @ KC) — SIT (Ramping Up)

**Why Sit:**
- Snap share concern: Only 31% of snaps in Week 14 return (vs. 69% for Vidal)
- Just returned from 7 games on IR with fractured ankle
- Tough matchup: Chiefs allow 6th-fewest fantasy points to RBs
- Split backfield: Kimani Vidal earned trust during Hampton's absence
- Low game total: Chargers-Chiefs O/U only 41.5 points

**Why He Has Future Upside:**
- Goal-line back: Had 5 red-zone rushing attempts in Week 14
- Scored TD: First career receiving touchdown in return game
- Pre-injury (Weeks 1-5): 74%+ snap share, 17+ touches/game

**Recent Performance:**
| Week | Snap % | Rush | Yards | Rec | TD | PPR |

| 14 (Return) | 31% | 13 | 56 | 2 | 1 | 12.7 |
