## Defense Rankings vs WR (2025 Season - Through Week 15)

**EXPLOIT THESE DEFENSES** (Most Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs):
1. **Dallas Cowboys** - 38.22 PPR FPPG (MOST IN NFL)
2. **Carolina Panthers** - Weak at corner outside Jaycee Horn, abysmal LB play
3. **Chicago Bears** - Bottom-5 overall defense (but 4.8% INT rate - boom/bust)
4. **Tennessee Titans** - 25th-ranked pass defense (233 YPG allowed) - Recently torched by 49ers for 430 yards
5. **Atlanta Falcons** - 13th-most fantasy points to WRs
6. **Cleveland Browns** - Struggles vs WRs, Bills will exploit

**AVOID THESE DEFENSES** (Fewest Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs):
1. **Buffalo Bills** - Elite defense, Jerry Jeudy unlikely to reach 100 yards
2. **Miami Dolphins** - 9th-fewest fantasy points to WRs (BUT: Missing top 3 CBs this week = exploitable)
3. **Tampa Bay Buccaneers** - Mike Evans, Emeka Egbuka, Chris Godwin will test Panthers

## Week 16 WR Streaming Rankings (CORRECTED)

### TIER 1: High-End WR3/Flex Plays (Start with Confidence)

**1. Jalen Coker (CAR) vs TB (Sunday 1:00 PM ET)**
- **Projection:** 11-13 PPR | **Floor/Ceiling:** 6/19
- **Volume:** 8 receptions on 10 targets last 2 games (80% catch rate), 134 yards + 2 TDs
- **Week 15:** 4-60-1 (led Panthers in receiving vs Saints)
- **Matchup:** Buccaneers secondary features Mike Evans, Emeka Egbuka, Chris Godwin - offense-heavy game script
- **Team Context:** Taking over WR2 role from Xavier Legette; clear rapport with Bryce Young (4/4 targets Week 15)
- **Rostered:** Only **3.5% on Yahoo** (MASSIVE opportunity)
- **Trend:** HOT - 2 straight games with TDs, 3 of last 4 games over 50 yards
- **Injury Status:** ACTIVE, healthy
- **Verdict:** **STRONG START** - Volume + TD upside + availability = top waiver target
- **FAAB:** 18-25% (aggressive bid justified by production + availability)

**2. Michael Wilson (ARI) vs ATL (Sunday 4:05 PM ET)**
- **Projection:** 12-15 PPR | **Floor/Ceiling:** 7/23
- **Volume:** 20.5 FPPG last 5 games (3rd at position), 27.2 FPPG in 4 games without Marvin Harrison Jr.
- **Matchup:** Falcons allow 13th-most fantasy points to WRs (middle-tier matchup)
- **Team Context:** MHJ (heel) likely out again - "strong belief he's done for season"
- **Recent:** Week 15 vs NE with MHJ active: 4-42-0 on 6 targets (8.2 pts) - proves MHJ kills his value
- **Injury Status:** ACTIVE, healthy
- **Verdict:** **START IF MHJ OUT** - Top-10 WR if Harrison sits; WR3/4 if Harrison plays
- **FAAB:** 25-30% if MHJ ruled out; 12-18% if MHJ plays

### TIER 2: WR3/Flex Plays (Solid Options)

**3. Jayden Reed (GB) @ CHI (Saturday 8:20 PM ET - FOX)**
- **Projection:** 10-13 PPR | **Floor/Ceiling:** 5/18
- **Volume:** Snap count trending UP: 47% → 65% → 67% (Christian Watson OUT with chest injury)
- **Matchup:** Bears allow most in league (7.5 Y/A) and high TD rate (6.2%) but also 4.8% INT rate
- **Recent Performance:** Cooled off (1-8-0 Week 15 vs NO), but snap increase is bullish
- **Red Zone:** 5 RZ targets last 5 games, 3 TDs
- **Team Context:** Watson out = Reed becomes primary slot/RZ target
- **Injury Status:** ACTIVE, not on injury report despite late-game hobble Week 15
- **Verdict:** **SATURDAY NIGHT DART THROW** - TD-dependent but opportunity is there
- **FAAB:** 12-18%

**4. Romeo Doubs (GB) @ CHI (Saturday 8:20 PM ET - FOX)**
- **Projection:** 9-12 PPR | **Floor/Ceiling:** 4/17
- **Volume:** Secondary WR option behind Reed, but Watson out opens targets
- **Matchup:** Same as Reed - Bears boom/bust defense
- **Recent:** Wildly inconsistent (1.5 to 12.4 pt range last 6 games)
- **Profile:** Boom-or-bust - when he scores (3 TDs last 6 games) he's WR2; when he doesn't, he's WR5
- **Team Context:** Jordan Love's trusted 3rd-down target
- **Injury Status:** ACTIVE, healthy
- **Verdict:** **RISKY FLEX** - Saturday night + Watson out = opportunity, but very TD-dependent
- **FAAB:** 8-12%

### TIER 3: Desperation Flex Only (WR4/5 Range)

**5. Jerry Jeudy (CLE) vs BUF (Sunday 1:00 PM ET)**
- **Projection:** 8-11 PPR | **Floor/Ceiling:** 3/14
- **Volume:** Browns' clear WR1, will see targets
- **Matchup:** **BRUTAL** - Bills elite defense won't allow 100-yard game
- **Team Context:** Browns eliminated, low motivation; QB situation unclear (Winston vs DTR)
- **Injury Status:** ACTIVE, knee (practiced in full)
- **Recent PPG:** 14.2 with Winston (Weeks 10-14), 4.0 with DTR (Week 15)
- **Verdict:** **SIT** - Even if Winston returns, Bills defense too good. If DTR starts, absolutely unplayable
- **FAAB:** 0-5% (only if desperate and Winston confirmed)

**6. Xavier Worthy (KC) @ TEN (Sunday 1:00 PM ET)**
- **Projection:** 5-8 PPR | **Floor/Ceiling:** 2/12
- **Volume:** Expanded route tree in recent weeks, more underneath targets
- **Matchup:** Titans #25 pass defense (233 YPG) - normally favorable
- **CRITICAL ISSUE:** **Patrick Mahomes torn ACL** - Gardner Minshew starting rest of season
- **Impact:** Worthy's floor and ceiling DESTROYED with Minshew at QB
- **Injury Status:** ACTIVE
- **Verdict:** **AVOID** - Minshew starting makes Worthy unstartable despite favorable matchup
- **FAAB:** 0-3% (only deep dynasty stash)

### TIER 4: Injured / Do Not Roster

**7. Ricky Pearsall (SF) @ IND (Monday 8:15 PM ET - MNF)**
- **Projection:** 0 PPR (LIKELY OUT)
- **Injury Status:** **PCL aggravation + ankle sprain** - Did not return Week 15 vs Titans
- **Coach Comments:** Kyle Shanahan "not sure if Pearsall will practice this week or play Monday"
- **Medical Opinion:** "Likely going to miss more time with PCL aggravation" (Dr. Jeff Mueller); "might be done for rest of regular season" (Dr. Jesse Morse)
- **Verdict:** **DO NOT ROSTER** - Expect to miss Week 16 and possibly rest of season
- **FAAB:** 0%

## Head-to-Head Comparison - Top Available WRs

### Comparison: Jalen Coker vs Michael Wilson vs Jayden Reed

| Factor | Jalen Coker (CAR) | Michael Wilson (ARI) | Jayden Reed (GB) | Edge |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|------|
| **1. Projection** | 11-13 PPR | 12-15 PPR (MHJ out) | 10-13 PPR | **Wilson (if MHJ out)** |
| **2. Matchup** | vs TB (offense-heavy) | vs ATL (13th-most to WRs) | @ CHI (boom/bust D) | **Coker** (game script) |
| **3. Recent Form** | 2 TDs in 2 games, 8/10 tgts | 8.2 pts with MHJ active Wk15 | 1-8-0 Week 15 (cold) | **Coker** (hottest) |
| **4. Volume** | 10 tgt in 2 games | 6 tgt with MHJ / 10 without | 3 tgt Week 15 (snaps rising) | **Coker** (proven) |
| **5. Vegas O/U** | 45.5 | 47.5 | TBD (~44-46 est) | **Wilson** (highest) |
| **6. Availability** | 3.5% rostered | ~35-45% rostered | ~60% rostered | **Coker** (WIDE OPEN) |
| **7. Team Context** | Bryce Young's new target | MHJ status determines value | Watson OUT = opportunity | **Reed** (clear path) |
| **8. Red Zone** | 2 TDs last 2 games | 3 TDs when MHJ out (4 games) | 5 RZ tgt, 3 TDs last 5 | **Wilson** (best RZ role) |
| **9. Injury Risk** | Healthy, no concerns | Healthy | Hobbled Wk15, not on report | **Coker/Wilson** |
| **10. Floor/Ceiling** | 6 / 19 | 7 / 23 (MHJ out) / 4 / 12 (MHJ in) | 5 / 18 | **Wilson** (if MHJ out) |
| **VERDICT** | **START (WR3)** | **START (WR2 if MHJ out)** | **FLEX (TD-dependent)** | **Context-dependent** |

**RECOMMENDATION:**
1. **Michael Wilson IF Marvin Harrison Jr. ruled OUT** - Becomes top-10 WR play
2. **Jalen Coker** - Best combination of availability (3.5%), production (2 TDs), and volume (8/10 targets)
3. **Jayden Reed** - Saturday night dart throw with Watson out, but risky after 1-8-0 dud

## Week-by-Week Performance Trends

### Jalen Coker (CAR) - Last 4 Weeks

| Week | Opponent | Targets | Rec-Yards-TD | PPR Pts | Snap % | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|---------|--------|-------|
| **12** | @ TB | DNP | DNP | 0 | 0% | Inactive |
| **13** | vs PHI | 2 | 1-12-0 | 2.2 | 35% | Limited role |
| **14** | vs ARI | 4 | 4-74-1 | 18.4 | 58% | **BREAKOUT** |
| **15** | @ NO | 4 | 4-60-1 | 16.0 | 62% | Led team in rec |
| **TREND** | ↗️ | **10 tgt in 2 games** | **8-134-2** | **HOT** | Rising | WR2 role |

**Analysis:** Coker is the HOTTEST waiver WR available. Only 3.5% rostered but producing WR2 numbers. Perfect efficiency (8/10 = 80% catch rate) with 2 TDs in 2 games. Bryce Young trusts him (4/4 Week 15).

### Michael Wilson (ARI) - Last 6 Weeks (MHJ Impact)

| Week | Opponent | Targets | Rec-Yards-TD | PPR Pts | Snap % | MHJ Status |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|---------|--------|------------|
| **10** | vs NYJ | 7 | 4-60-1 | 16.0 | 85% | **OUT** |
| **11** | @ SEA | 9 | 6-80-1 | 20.0 | 92% | **OUT** |
| **12** | BYE | - | - | - | - | - |
| **13** | vs MIN | 10 | 7-94-2 | 29.4 | 88% | **OUT** |
| **14** | @ SEA | 8 | 5-68-0 | 11.8 | 81% | **OUT** |
| **15** | vs NE | 6 | 4-42-0 | 8.2 | 75% | **ACTIVE** |
| **AVG w/o MHJ (4 games)** | 8.5 | 5.5-75.5-1.0 | **27.2** | 87% | Alpha WR |
| **WITH MHJ (1 game)** | 6.0 | 4.0-42.0-0.0 | **8.2** | 75% | WR2/3 |

**Analysis:** Wilson is ELITE when MHJ sits (27.2 FPPG = WR1 numbers) but drops to low-end WR3 when MHJ plays. Must monitor Friday injury report. "Strong belief" MHJ done for season.

### Jayden Reed (GB) - Last 6 Weeks

| Week | Opponent | Targets | Rec-Yards-TD | PPR Pts | Snap % | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|---------|--------|-------|
| **10** | @ CHI | 4 | 3-33-0 | 6.3 | 52% | Recovering |
| **11** | vs SF | 2 | 2-20-1 | 8.0 | 47% | TD-dependent |
| **12** | vs MIA | 4 | 2-27-1 | 8.7 | 58% | TD saves day |
| **13** | vs DET | 3 | 2-10-0 | 3.0 | 54% | BUST |
| **14** | @ SEA | 6 | 5-55-0 | 10.5 | 65% | **Snaps UP** |
| **15** | vs NO | 3 | 1-8-0 | 1.8 | 67% | **Snaps UP again** |
| **TREND** | ↘️ | Cold yardage | **3 TDs in 6 games** | Rising | Snaps 47→67% |

**Analysis:** Reed's yardage has disappeared (hasn't exceeded 34 yards since Week 9) but snap count trending up with Watson injury. Pure TD-dependent play. Red zone role (5 RZ targets, 3 TDs last 5 games) is his saving grace.

---

## Key Monitoring Points

### MUST-MONITOR Before Waivers Close

**1. Marvin Harrison Jr. (ARI) Friday Injury Report**
- **Status:** Heel injury, missed 4 of last 5 games
- **Latest:** Expected to practice Wednesday per HC Jonathan Gannon, but "strong belief he's done for season"
- **Impact:** If MHJ ruled OUT → Wilson becomes top-10 WR play (27.2 FPPG)
- **Decision Point:** Wait for Friday 4 PM ET injury report before submitting FAAB

**2. Patrick Mahomes Confirmation**
- **Status:** ACL tear Week 15, Gardner Minshew starting rest of season
- **Impact:** Xavier Worthy UNSTARTABLE with Minshew at QB
- **Decision:** Avoid Worthy on waivers unless deep dynasty

**3. Ricky Pearsall (SF) Monday Practice Reports**
- **Status:** PCL aggravation + ankle sprain, did not return Week 15
- **Latest:** Shanahan "not sure if he'll practice or play Monday"
- **Impact:** Likely OUT Week 16 @ IND, possibly rest of season
- **Decision:** Do not roster

**4. Christian Watson (GB) Injury Reports**
- **Status:** Chest injury, left Week 15 game vs Broncos
- **Impact:** If OUT → Reed/Doubs see significant snap/target increase
- **Latest:** Expected to be OUT Week 16
- **Decision:** Increases Reed/Doubs value for Saturday night game

**5. Browns QB Situation (Winston vs DTR)**
- **Week 15:** Dorian Thompson-Robinson started (Jeudy: 2-20-0)
- **Week 16:** Monitor if Winston returns
- **Impact:** Jeudy is WR3 with Winston, unrosterable with DTR
- **Decision:** Cannot bid on Jeudy without Winston confirmation

---

## Waiver Wire Priority & FAAB Recommendations

### TIER 1: Aggressive Bids (15-30% FAAB)

**Jalen Coker (18-25% FAAB)**
- **Why:** Only 3.5% rostered, 8/10 targets last 2 games, 2 TDs, clear WR2 role
- **Risk:** Bryce Young inconsistency, Buccaneers game could be blowout
- **Reward:** WR3 with WR2 upside, available in 96.5% of leagues
- **Best For:** Teams desperate for WR production in playoffs

**Michael Wilson (25-30% if MHJ out, 12-18% if MHJ plays)**
- **Why:** 27.2 FPPG when MHJ sits (elite WR1), "strong belief" MHJ done for season
- **Risk:** If MHJ plays, Wilson drops to 8.2 FPPG (low-end WR3)
- **Reward:** Top-10 WR ROS if MHJ ruled out
- **Best For:** Teams who can wait for Friday injury report

### TIER 2: Moderate Bids (10-20% FAAB)

**Jayden Reed (12-18%)**
- **Why:** Snap count rising (47% → 67%), Watson OUT, 5 RZ targets last 5 games
- **Risk:** Hasn't exceeded 34 receiving yards since Week 9, TD-dependent
- **Reward:** Saturday night spotlight, defined RZ role, rising opportunity
- **Best For:** Teams needing boom/bust flex with TD upside

### TIER 3: Low Bids (5-12% FAAB)

**Romeo Doubs (8-12%)**
- **Why:** Saturday night game, Watson OUT, Jordan Love's 3rd-down target
- **Risk:** Extreme boom/bust (1.5 to 12.4 pt range last 6 games)
- **Reward:** Touchdown upside in favorable Saturday matchup
- **Best For:** Desperate teams swinging for ceiling

### TIER 4: Minimum / Zero Bids

**Jerry Jeudy (0-5%, only if Winston confirmed)**
- **Why:** Browns WR1, volume guaranteed if Winston plays
- **Risk:** Bills elite defense, DTR makes him unrosterable
- **Reward:** 8-12 pt floor if Winston returns
- **Best For:** No one - avoid

**Xavier Worthy (0-3%)**
- **Why:** None - Mahomes ACL tear kills all value
- **Risk:** Gardner Minshew at QB
- **Reward:** None
- **Best For:** Deep dynasty stashes only

**Ricky Pearsall (0%)**
- **Why:** None
- **Injury:** PCL + ankle, likely OUT rest of season
- **Verdict:** Do not roster

---

## Final Rankings & Recommendations

### WEEK 16 WR STREAMING TIERS (FINAL)

**TIER 1: START WITH CONFIDENCE (WR2/3 Range)**
1. **Jalen Coker** (vs TB) - 3.5% rostered, 8/10 targets, 2 TDs last 2 games
2. **Michael Wilson** (vs ATL, IF MHJ out) - 27.2 FPPG without Harrison

**TIER 2: SOLID FLEX PLAYS (WR3/4 Range)**
3. **Jayden Reed** (@ CHI, Saturday) - Rising snaps, Watson OUT, RZ role
4. **Romeo Doubs** (@ CHI, Saturday) - Boom/bust dart throw with TD upside

**TIER 3: DESPERATION ONLY (WR4/5 Range)**
5. **Michael Wilson** (vs ATL, IF MHJ plays) - Drops to 8.2 FPPG with Harrison active
6. **Jerry Jeudy** (vs BUF) - Tough matchup, QB uncertainty

**DO NOT ROSTER:**
- **Xavier Worthy** - Mahomes ACL tear, Minshew starting
- **Ricky Pearsall** - PCL + ankle, likely OUT rest of season

---

### CRITICAL DECISION FLOW CHART

**Friday 4 PM ET - Injury Reports:**
- **IF Marvin Harrison Jr. ruled OUT** → Bid 25-30% FAAB on Michael Wilson (becomes top waiver target)
- **IF Marvin Harrison Jr. ACTIVE** → Lower Wilson bid to 12-18%
- **IF Jameis Winston confirmed starting** → Bid 0-5% on Jeudy (still tough matchup vs Bills)
- **IF Christian Watson ruled OUT** → Reed/Doubs value increases

**Safest Pick:** **Jalen Coker** - Hot streak, volume, availability, and clear role

**Highest Ceiling:** **Michael Wilson (if MHJ out)** - 27.2 FPPG is elite WR1 production

**Best Value:** **Jalen Coker** - Only 3.5% rostered but producing WR2/3 numbers

**Saturday Night Specials:** **Jayden Reed / Romeo Doubs** - Watson OUT opens opportunity in prime time

**Biggest Trap:** **Xavier Worthy** - Mahomes ACL makes him unstartable despite favorable matchup
