We are going to update the draft_helper to accept the same json file that is currently being used in the Simulation to define parameter configs.
All 23 parameters outlined in the json file should be removed from Config files, and instead have their values passed in to the draft helper via the json file.
The Draft Helper and Starter Helper should be passed the json file as part of its constructor, then use a new ParameterJsonManager class to parse the json and store the parameter values.
Wherever those parameters are used, the ParameterJsonManager should be accessed to fetch the current values.
The run_draft_helper.py and run_starter_helper file should default to providing a path to parameters.json contained in shared_files alongside files like players.csv
The starter helper that is accessed via the draft helper should use the same parameter json as the draft helper
There is already a parameters.json file within the shared_files folder that you can use for reference and testing
After you finish integrating the json parameters into the draft helper and starter helper, systematically look through every parameter and make sure they are being used correctly in the corresponding project files.


SIMULATION UPDATES:
The Simulation should be updated to no longer use injection for the parameter values, and instead just be passing the json file being tested to the draft helper and starter helper
The version of the parameter files that has the parameter keys associated with a list of values has been moved to a parameter_sets sub-folder. Simulations will continue to run by being provided one of these files or looking for the latest version of the file in that directory. The simulation will then be testing combinations of parameters based on the ones contained in the arrays like before.
The difference now is that the combinations of parameters should be turned into json files that are placed in draft_helper/simulation/parameters/parameter_runs and those json files will then be provided to the draft helper and starter helper during the simulation of drafts and week to week matches
Be very systematic in ensuring all parameters are being properly read in and tested by the simulation
