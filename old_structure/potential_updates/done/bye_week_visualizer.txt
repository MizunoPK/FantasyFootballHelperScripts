I want to add another type of display for the roster in the waiver optimizer and trade simulator.
When displaying the roster, I want a summary to also display beneath the roster saying which players have bye weeks on what week.
Do not display bye weeks that have already passed (based on the current week setting from config)

Here is an example of what it may look like, though the bye week data here in this example is wrong:
Bye Week Summary...
Week 5: Tucker Kraft (TE)
Week 6: None
Week 7: Omarion Hampton (RB), Justin Fields (QB)
...
